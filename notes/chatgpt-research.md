Planning a Finance Web App: Tech Stack Review and Step-by-Step Guide
Tech Stack Review and Recommendations
Your proposed tech stack is state-of-the-art and covers most needs for a modern full-stack web application. Let's break down each category and see if any additions or removals are needed:
Framework & Core: Next.js 15.4.4 with React 19 and TypeScript 5 is an excellent choice. Next.js's App Router uses the latest React features (Server Components, Suspense, etc.) for a hybrid SSR/SPA approach
nextjs.org
. This ensures high performance and flexibility. React 19 + React DOM 19 bring improvements like new hooks and better server-side rendering support (Next.js 15 has full support for React 19’s features
dev.to
). No changes needed here – this is a solid foundation.
Styling: Tailwind CSS 4 is a great utility-first CSS framework, letting you build designs rapidly with pre-made utility classes
tailwindcss.com
. It keeps your CSS manageable and consistent. You also listed Styled Components 6; you might not need both Tailwind and styled-components. Many projects use one or the other. Tailwind can handle most styling needs with utility classes, whereas styled-components is useful for more dynamic or encapsulated styles. If you prefer using Tailwind for almost everything (which is common), you could drop styled-components to simplify the stack. However, if you have specific use-cases for CSS-in-JS (theming, dynamic styles), you can use them together in a limited way (there are libraries like twin.macro that integrate the two). In summary, keep Tailwind, and use styled-components only if necessary. The Tailwind Typography plugin (@tailwindcss/typography) is a good addition for nicely rendering rich text content, and Framer Motion 12 will cover your animation needs (it pairs well with React for interactive UI animations).
Content Management: Sanity 4.2.0 (headless CMS) with its tooling (@sanity/client, @sanity/vision, Portable Text) is a powerful way to manage content. If your app includes editorial content (blog posts, articles, explanatory pages), Sanity will allow non-developers (or you, via Studio) to manage that content. Sanity stores content in the cloud and makes it accessible via queries (GROQ or GraphQL), returning rich data (including Portable Text for rich text) that you can render in Next.js
medium.com
. If the project is primarily an interactive app (dashboards, data from APIs) and not serving a lot of static content, you could opt out of a CMS initially to reduce complexity. However, having Sanity in the stack means down the line you can easily add a blog or help center. It’s fine to keep it on the list, just be mindful that it will require defining schemas and integrating the Sanity Studio into your workflow. In short, include Sanity if you plan to have user-facing content that you want to update frequently without redeploying the site.
Database & Backend: Supabase 2.53.0 is an excellent Backend-as-a-Service choice. It gives you a PostgreSQL database with an auto-generated REST API, real-time capabilities, file storage, and authentication out of the box. Using Supabase means you don't have to manage your own database server, and you get handy features like Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation. Supabase’s Auth module makes it easy to implement user sign-up/login with various methods (email/password, magic links, OAuth, etc.)
supabase.com
. The Supabase JS client will allow your Next.js app to talk to the database directly (for example, to read/write user data). One important thing: enable RLS on your tables and use policies to ensure each user can only access their own data – Supabase allows defining granular access rules in SQL for secure multi-user access
supabase.com
 (this is especially valuable for a finance app where each user's data must be isolated
supabase.com
). The inclusion of @supabase/ssr suggests you plan to use Supabase with Next.js Server Components or Server-side rendering, which is great for protecting data fetching with the user's session. No removals here; Supabase covers both your database and auth needs in one integrated solution.
Code Editor: Monaco Editor 0.52.2 (the engine behind VS Code) with @monaco-editor/react is in the list. This is somewhat niche for a finance web app, but if you plan features like letting users write scripts (for example, a custom screener logic, or note-taking with code snippets, or even an embedded IDE for testing financial models), Monaco is a good choice. It provides a rich text editor with syntax highlighting and intellisense capabilities. If this is not an immediate priority, you could defer adding Monaco to the project until later to avoid adding weight to the app. But since it’s listed, I assume you have a plan for it (perhaps allowing users to write and run small code for analysis). It’s fine to keep – just be aware of bundle size and load it lazily when needed.
Markdown & Content Processing: The stack includes React Markdown 10.1.0, Remark 15, Rehype 13, and plugins like Rehype Prism (for syntax highlighting code blocks), Rehype Slug & Autolink (for linking headings). This indicates you'll be rendering markdown content in the app. This aligns well if you have a blog (from Sanity) or if users can input notes in markdown. These tools will take markdown text and convert to HTML/React elements, with syntax highlighting for code. The inclusion is good; just ensure you configure rehype/remark properly (e.g., using rehype-sanitize if you render any user-generated markdown, to prevent XSS). No changes needed here – this will nicely format any rich text content in your app.
Payments: Stripe (@stripe/stripe-js 7.7.0) for payments is a logical choice if you plan to have a premium tier or any paid feature. Stripe is well-supported and secure for handling credit card payments and subscriptions. The version listed is the Stripe.js client library (for handling checkout or Elements on the frontend). You’ll also likely use Stripe’s backend APIs (via your Next.js API routes) and webhooks to handle events like payment confirmations. The tech stack is fine as is. Eventually, you'll set up Stripe webhooks and secure them in your Next.js backend. It might be worth also including stripe npm package (server-side SDK) when you implement the backend part. No removals here – keep Stripe since monetization is planned.
Development Tools: ESLint 9, Autoprefixer 10.4.21, PostCSS, etc., are all standard and good to have. ESLint will keep your code consistent and catch issues early. Tailwind integrates with PostCSS and Autoprefixer under the hood to ensure your CSS works across browsers, so those are needed. You might also add Prettier for code formatting (often ESLint and Prettier are used together). In any case, no problems here – these tools will improve code quality and maintainability.
Environment & Configuration: Dotenv 17.2.1 and dotenv-flow 4.1.0 are for environment variable management. Dotenv allows loading variables from a .env file into process.env in development. Dotenv-flow extends that to manage multiple .env files for different environments (development, test, production, etc.), which can be handy. Using env files is a secure way to handle secrets (API keys, DB URLs) because those values won't be committed to your repo or exposed to client-side code
stackoverflow.com
. Just ensure that in production (e.g., Vercel) you configure the environment variables in the hosting settings, since you wouldn't use dotenv in a serverless environment. This setup is good – it indicates you’re mindful of not hardcoding secrets.
Additional Libraries to Consider:
Data Visualization (Charts): Since your app will have dashboards and charts, you will need a charting library (the stack list didn't explicitly mention one). A popular choice is Recharts (a React library built on D3) for its simplicity and React-like API. It’s widely used and well-maintained, making it easy to create responsive charts by composing components
blog.logrocket.com
. Developers praise Recharts for its straightforward API and clean SVG rendering
blog.logrocket.com
. Another option is Chart.js with react-chartjs-2, or Nivo, or even D3.js directly for custom visuals. Given 2025 trends, Recharts remains a top choice (24k+ GitHub stars, used in many React apps)
blog.logrocket.com
. You might want to add one of these to your stack to handle line charts, bar graphs, etc., for financial data.
UI Component Library: With Tailwind, you get design flexibility, but you might consider using pre-built headless components to speed up development. Libraries like Headless UI (by Tailwind Labs) or Radix UI provide unstyled accessible components (dropdowns, modals, toggles) that you can style with Tailwind. Another is shadcn/ui, which is a collection of accessible Tailwind + Radix components. This isn't mandatory, but could be a helpful addition for common UI elements.
State Management: For most parts, Next.js with React 19 can handle state via hooks and context. But if your app grows, you might consider a global state solution for things like user settings or caching data across pages. Modern options include Zustand (lightweight state management) or even using the Context API with the new React 19 features. You likely don't need Redux unless doing very complex state management. Keep this in mind as you build – you can introduce it if needed.
Testing Frameworks: It’s not in your list, but be sure to include testing tools. For unit/integration tests, Jest and React Testing Library are the de facto choices. For end-to-end tests (especially important for flows like authentication or payments), consider Cypress or Playwright. This will ensure your app remains robust as you add features. You can add these dev dependencies at any time, but earlier is better to start writing tests.
In summary, your tech stack is quite comprehensive and modern. The main suggestion is to choose a charting library, and decide on Tailwind vs styled-components usage (likely Tailwind primarily). Everything else (Next.js, React, TS, Supabase, Sanity, Stripe, etc.) aligns well with building a feature-rich finance web application.
Clarify Project Requirements and Missing Details
Before diving into development, it's important to clarify some details of your project. You provided a broad vision, and to make sure the implementation goes smoothly, consider the following questions and decisions:
Financial Data Sources: Identify which APIs or data feeds you will use for market data (stock prices, company info) and financial statements. For stock prices and fundamentals, do you plan to use a service like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, IEX Cloud, or another? Each has different capabilities, pricing, and real-time access. For example, Alpha Vantage offers free stock time-series data but with rate limits, Finnhub offers real-time data with a free tier, etc. Similarly, for SEC filings, the SEC has an official EDGAR JSON API that provides company filing data without authentication
sec.gov
. Will you use the SEC's API directly (which provides filings in JSON, updated real-time), or a third-party aggregator (like sec-api.io or Financial Modeling Prep) that might have friendlier endpoints? Deciding this upfront is crucial as it affects how you'll implement data fetching. Action: Research a bit and choose a primary market data API and how to access SEC filings (direct EDGAR vs third-party).
AI/ML Features Scope: You mentioned "interpreting SEC filings with AI/ML". Clarify how you envision this working for the user. For instance:
Will the user click on a company and see an AI-generated summary of the latest 10-K/10-Q report?
Or can they ask questions about a filing (chatbot style)?
Do you plan to use a large language model (like OpenAI GPT-4 via API) to generate these insights, or a smaller/embedded model? Using an API like OpenAI is straightforward (just send the text and a prompt), but costs money per call. Alternatively, there are open-source models or toolkits (like sec-ai, an open-source SEC filing analysis toolkit
github.com
 in Python) that could be self-hosted. The open-source route might require more setup (and potentially a powerful server if analyzing large documents with AI).
In short, define whether you'll integrate with an AI API (quick to implement, pay-per-use) or build/train something yourself. Also clarify what type of insights you want (summary, risk factors, financial metrics extraction, etc.), as that will guide how you prompt the AI or what model you need.
User Dashboard and Personalization: You plan for users to have dashboards. What data and widgets should a user's dashboard contain?
Commonly, a personalized dashboard might show their watchlist or portfolio performance, news or alerts for their followed stocks, maybe an overview of market indices, and any custom alerts.
Will users be able to create a watchlist of stocks? If so, you need to allow adding/removing symbols to a watchlist and store that in your database (this ties into authentication – each user’s data must be saved).
Will there be a portfolio tracking feature (users input how many shares they own, etc.) or is it read-only data? This could massively increase scope, so likely it's just watchlist and analysis rather than full portfolio management unless specified.
The dashboard could also include the AI insights (e.g., "latest filing summary for your watchlist companies") to make it immediately useful upon login.
Notifications: You mentioned notifications and possibly email (Gmail) integration. Clarify what events trigger notifications:
Price alerts? (e.g., notify if a stock in watchlist goes above or below a threshold)
New SEC filing published for a watchlist company?
General news or newsletters?
Once you know the events, decide on notification delivery: in-app notifications (a bell icon with unread messages), email notifications, or even SMS/push. For emails, you can integrate an email service or use something like Gmail SMTP via Nodemailer. For in-app, you can use a combination of database + real-time (Supabase can stream updates). Also, if using email, consider scheduling (like a daily digest vs instant alerts).
"Gmail gathering": This is a bit unclear – do you want to pull data from the user’s Gmail account, or send emails to the user's Gmail? Phrased as "gmail gathering," it sounds like you might want to read the user’s emails (with their permission) to gather certain info. For example, some finance apps connect to your email to find trade confirmations, receipts, or newsletter subscriptions and aggregate them. If that's the case:
You'll need to use the Gmail API via OAuth. Users would authenticate with Google and grant your app read access to their Gmail (likely with specific scopes like Gmail read-only). Then your app can scan for relevant emails (perhaps emails from EDGAR, broker statements, or specific senders).
Keep in mind, obtaining broad Gmail access might require a sensitive scope verification by Google if this goes to production for many users. It's doable (many apps do it), but there's a process to get your app approved by Google for those scopes.
On a technical level, you'd use Google’s Node.js API client or direct HTTPS calls to Gmail API. The Gmail API allows reading messages, searching by query, etc.
dev.to
. You'd have to decide what to do with the data – for instance, extract PDF statements or just show certain alerts. This feature might be a later phase since it's quite separate from the core stock analysis functionality. If it's not a priority, you can table it for now. If it is a priority, plan out the OAuth integration and how you'll use the data.
Hosting and Deployment: You expressed uncertainty about hosting and what is most efficient. Given your stack, Vercel is a top choice for the Next.js app. It will automatically handle building and deploying your Next.js project, and you get benefits like edge network, serverless functions for API routes, and easy integration with Git. In fact, Vercel has an integration with Supabase that can set up environment variables and webhook endpoints automatically
github.com
github.com
. Many developers deploy Next.js + Supabase apps on Vercel for convenience. Supabase itself is a hosted service, so your database and auth are taken care of by them (no server to manage). Sanity is also hosted (if using Sanity’s managed dataset). The only part left is any external services (Stripe, etc., which are SaaS). So, using Vercel (or a similar platform like Netlify) would likely be the most efficient and hassle-free. If you have reasons to self-host (e.g., enterprise requirements, or wanting everything on AWS), you could containerize the app or use Next.js on AWS Lambda, but that’s more complex for little gain in most cases. So, the recommendation is to plan for deploying on Vercel, which is optimized for Next.js.
Security and Compliance: You noted you're not aware of security needs – in finance, security is paramount. Think about:
Data Privacy: Will you be storing any personal data beyond an email and maybe name for accounts? Likely not much, but if you pull in Gmail data or store any user financial info, you must handle it carefully (encrypt sensitive fields if any, etc.). Even watchlist info is somewhat personal, but not highly sensitive. Just enforce proper auth.
Regulatory: If your app is just providing tools and information, you likely aren’t subject to financial regulations (like FINRA or SEC regulations) since you’re not a broker or advisor. Just be careful not to inadvertently give personalized investment advice (as that can cross into regulated territory). Providing analysis and data is fine; just perhaps include disclaimers that it's for informational purposes.
Security Testing: Plan to do threat modeling for your app (we will cover specific security measures later in the guide, but keep it in mind as a requirement).
By clarifying the above points, you'll have a more concrete roadmap and avoid big surprises during development. Feel free to refine your project scope with these in mind or ask further questions on specifics. Getting these answers will ensure that when you start building, you know what components and integrations to focus on.
High-Level Architecture Overview
Let's outline how the pieces of your tech stack will work together to fulfill the features, incorporating the points clarified above. This will be the blueprint of your system:
Next.js 15 Application: This is the core of your web app, acting as both the frontend and backend. Next.js (with App Router) will serve React pages to users and also handle server-side logic via API routes or Server Actions. It allows you to mix server-rendered content (for SEO or security) with client-side interactivity. The App Router uses a file-based routing system and can seamlessly integrate server and client components
nextjs.org
. This means, for example, you can fetch data from Supabase or external APIs in a Server Component (running on the server) and send that UI down to the client, hydrated with data – very powerful for a finance app where SEO might not be critical but performance and security of data fetching is.
Supabase (Database and Auth): Supabase will function as your primary database (PostgreSQL) and user authentication system. All user-specific data can live here. For instance:
Authentication: Users sign up/log in via Supabase Auth. Supabase manages the user identities and provides JWT tokens. In your Next.js app, you'll use the Supabase client to check the user session. You can also leverage Supabase Auth Helpers for Next.js to easily retrieve the user on the server side (e.g., in middleware or server components).
Database: You will have tables for things like user profiles, watchlists, saved screener criteria, notifications, etc. Supabase’s advantage is that from the browser or server you can directly query the database with the provided JS client, and the RLS rules in Postgres will ensure each user can only access their own rows
supabase.com
. For example, you might have a watchlist table with columns: user_id, symbol, created_at. An RLS policy can allow SELECT/INSERT for a row only if user_id = auth.uid() (the logged-in user's ID) – meaning each user only sees their watchlist symbols
supabase.com
. This way, even if someone tried to meddle with requests, the database itself guards the data.
Realtime: Supabase has a realtime feature (using PostgreSQL replication slots) where the client can subscribe to changes in the database. This could be used for things like updating a dashboard in real-time if, say, you had a live feed of prices being inserted into the DB (though in your case, live prices might come directly from an API rather than your database). Still, for things like notifications or chat messages, Supabase realtime could be useful. It’s there if you need it.
Sanity CMS: Sanity will be an external service that stores content. The Sanity Studio (which you’ll set up separately) is where content is created/edited. For your Next.js app, Sanity is accessed via its client API. So, if you have, say, a “Blog” section:
You might have a Sanity schema for blog posts (title, body, etc.). Content creators (or you) add posts via Sanity Studio.
In Next.js, on a page like /blog/[slug], you’d use @sanity/client to fetch the post by slug. That returns JSON including Portable Text for the body.
You then use @portabletext/react or similar to render that to HTML in the React component.
This decouples content from code – you can update content in Sanity without redeploying. It’s mainly used for static or slowly-changing content (it’s not for the stock data, but for explanatory text, guides, etc.). Sanity’s content is delivered over CDN and is queryable, making it efficient and scalable.
External Financial Data APIs: These will be crucial for your stock screener and real-time data:
Stock Price Data: Assuming you choose an API like Alpha Vantage or Finnhub, your Next.js server will need to fetch data from it. You will likely create API routes in Next.js as a middleman. For example, a route /api/quote?symbol=AAPL that when called, server-side fetches the AAPL quote from the external API (using the API key from env variables) and returns the data. This keeps your API key off the client and allows you to process or cache data as needed. The Next.js API routes run on Vercel as serverless functions (or Edge Functions if using that), and can securely communicate with third-party APIs.
If you need streaming data (real-time quotes), you might either:
Use the API’s websocket in the client (some providers offer a websocket you can connect to from the browser with a public key). This would bypass Next.js for that live channel and go direct. But ensure not to expose secrets – usually, real-time feeds require an API key, which you might not want to put in client. Some solutions: use a less-sensitive key or an anonymous feed if available, or have your own small proxy that upgrades to a WebSocket server.
Or use Supabase's realtime by pumping data into the DB, but that’s complex and probably unnecessary if an API already provides a socket.
SEC Filings Data: The SEC EDGAR system provides RESTful endpoints. For example, there's an endpoint to get all submissions (filings) for a given company by its CIK (unique ID)
sec.gov
, and endpoints for specific financial facts. You might use this to get a JSON of recent filings, then pick the latest 10-K/10-Q, and possibly fetch the full text (which might be in HTML format from EDGAR). Alternatively, a third-party like sec-api.io can give you filings in JSON or text with less parsing. In your architecture, you could have an API route like /api/filings?symbol=XYZ:
That route converts the stock ticker XYZ to a CIK (EDGAR requires CIK). You might maintain a mapping or call a search endpoint.
Then it fetches the JSON of filings from data.sec.gov (with proper headers – SEC asks for a User-Agent with contact info). No auth needed for SEC’s API
sec.gov
.
You then filter or format that data (maybe store it in Supabase for caching, maybe not).
For analysis, you might even fetch the HTML text of the filing from the SEC (they provide links to the documents).
This work is done server-side in Next.js, and the result (filing content or summary) is sent to the client.
Other Data: If your screener includes fundamental criteria (P/E ratio, etc.), you might need an API that provides those or calculate from data. Some APIs provide fundamental data. Or you might pull some data from financial statements via the SEC’s XBRL API (which gives specific financial metrics from filings)
sec.gov
. This can be an advanced step – possibly out of scope for v1. But architecturally, any such data fetch would also happen server-side in Next and be exposed via an API route or pre-fetched in a server component.
AI/ML Integration: Depending on your decision (OpenAI or custom model):
If using an AI API (OpenAI/others): Your Next.js backend will handle calls to the AI. For instance, you might have an API route /api/analyze-filing that takes a piece of text (or an identifier for a filing) and a query (like "summarize" or a specific question). On the server, you construct a prompt for the AI and call the external AI API. The API key for the AI is stored in an env var, so it’s not exposed. The AI API (e.g., OpenAI) returns the result (e.g., a summary text), and your route sends that to the frontend. This keeps the process secure and allows you to post-process the response if needed. The user sees the AI-generated result on their dashboard or stock page. This decoupling is nice because you can easily swap the AI service or tweak prompts server-side without affecting the client.
If using a self-hosted model or open-source toolkit: You might run a separate service. For example, a Python service using the sec-ai toolkit or Hugging Face models. That service could be hosted on a server or as a microservice (if small, maybe you could even run it inside a Next.js API route via something like Pyodide or Wasm, but likely easier to run separate). Your Next.js app would send a request to that service (similar to calling an external API). This adds complexity because you have to maintain that service, but gives you more control (and no per-call cost aside from infrastructure).
In either case, the architecture treats AI analysis as an external capability triggered from your backend. The user interface will perhaps have a loading state like "Analyzing filing..." and then display the result. You might also cache results in your database to avoid re-computation (e.g., store the summary of a given 10-K in Supabase so that subsequent users or visits can retrieve it quickly).
Monaco Editor (Code Editor): If/when you incorporate Monaco, it will run in the browser as part of the React app. You might embed it in a page like /screener/custom where advanced users can write a script or formula. The Monaco editor component will load the WebAssembly or web worker stuff it needs. If those scripts are heavy, you can load Monaco dynamically (only when the user navigates to that part of the app). From an architecture perspective, Monaco doesn’t call the backend on its own – it’s just an editor. But you may pair it with some backend logic if you allow users to execute code. For example, maybe you let users write a small JavaScript snippet to calculate a custom metric on financial data; you could run that securely on the backend (using something like a sandboxed Node VM or a cloud function). That would require sending the code to the server via an API call. This is an edge case – depends on your feature decisions. Initially, Monaco will just be a fancy text editor in the app.
Stripe Payments: Stripe will be somewhat external but integrated:
On the frontend, you’ll use @stripe/stripe-js to initialize Stripe and perhaps use Stripe Checkout or Elements. For example, a user clicks "Upgrade to Premium", your React code uses Stripe.js to redirect to a Checkout page hosted by Stripe (which is the simplest way). This uses your Stripe publishable key (exposed to the frontend, safe).
On the backend, you’ll have a Stripe webhook listener. Vercel can handle webhooks by creating an API route for them (mark it as dynamic and handle the raw body). Stripe will send events like checkout.session.completed. In that handler, you verify the event (using your Stripe secret key and signing secret) and then update your Supabase DB – e.g., mark the user as premium, store their Stripe customer ID or subscription ID in a table. You might also create an API route that creates Stripe Checkout sessions server-side (to include things like the price ID and user ID in the metadata). The popular approach is to use Stripe’s customer portal and webhooks to sync subscription status. The Vercel example project for subscriptions uses this exact architecture: Next.js API routes + Supabase to store user subscription info
github.com
.
The architecture ensures financial transactions are handled securely by Stripe (you never handle raw card data, Stripe does), and your app just updates state based on Stripe’s notifications.
Notifications:
In-App: You can have a notifications table in Supabase. When something notable happens (new filing, price alert triggered, etc.), you insert a row for that user. If the user is online and has the app open, you could use Supabase’s real-time subscription to get that notification instantly in the client (the Supabase JS client can subscribe to database changes). Or, simpler, use SWR or polling to check periodically. Real-time makes it instant: for example, subscribe to postgres_changes on the notifications table where user_id = current user. When a new row is inserted, your client gets it and you can display a toast or an update on a notification bell icon.
Email: For sending emails (outside of Gmail integration), you might use an external email service. But you can also use something like Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP to send emails from, say, your own Gmail account for low-volume (not really scalable or recommended for production). A better approach is to use an email API (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) or if using Supabase, they allow configuring SMTP for auth emails – you could possibly use the same for custom emails. In your architecture, an email alert would be triggered by your backend logic (for example, a cron job or an event). If using Vercel, note that long-running cron jobs aren’t native, but you can use scheduled serverless functions or external schedulers.
External integrations: If you wanted, you could also integrate push notifications (web push) that require service worker and subscription to push service – this is advanced and can be considered later.
Gmail Integration (if implemented):
This part of the architecture involves Google’s OAuth. The user would click "Connect your Gmail" on your site. You redirect them to Google’s OAuth consent screen (with scopes like Gmail read-only). After they consent, Google redirects back to your app (a callback URL you configure) with a code. Next.js would handle that in an API route or page, exchange the code for tokens (using your Google client secret). Then you store the refresh token (since you need long-term access) securely in Supabase (probably encrypted or at least in a private table).
Now your app can use that token to call Gmail API endpoints. For example, you might have a server-side process that, once a day or on demand, reads the user’s inbox for specific things (perhaps look for certain senders or subjects). The Gmail API allows querying messages and retrieving them. You could extract useful info and maybe store it (e.g., parse out some data or just list those emails in the dashboard).
Because this involves user data, make sure this process is secure and that you request only the minimum scopes needed (perhaps just Gmail read metadata vs full read, depending on what you need). Also provide a way for users to disconnect (which would delete the token).
As part of architecture, this feature is somewhat siloed: it's not required for the core stock/finance functionality, but rather an add-on data source. So you could encapsulate it where, say, a component on the dashboard calls a Next.js API like /api/get-gmail-data which then uses the stored tokens to fetch and return relevant info.
All these components come together in the Next.js app as the hub. The beauty of Next.js is that you can treat external services (Supabase, Sanity, Stripe, Google, AI APIs, etc.) as data sources and unify them in your application layer:
A user interacts with the React frontend.
Those interactions trigger calls to either Next.js API routes or directly to services via SDKs.
Next.js (server) handles those requests: authenticating the user (via Supabase JWT or session), fetching/updating data from Supabase, calling external APIs as needed, and returning results.
The frontend updates to show new information (e.g., updated chart, AI summary, notification message).
The architecture is serverless-friendly and cloud-ready: each piece can scale. Supabase and Sanity handle their own scaling for DB and content. Vercel scales your Next.js endpoints. Stripe and Google are external and scalable by nature. This means your app should be able to handle increasing load without a major rewrite – you would mostly watch out for API rate limits (from data providers or OpenAI) as you scale and maybe add caching layers. To visualize it, imagine the user flow for a specific task, say "User views a stock and gets an AI summary of the latest filing":
User navigates to /stocks/ABC. Next.js server component fetches stock data from an external API (stock price, basic info) and maybe recent filings info via SEC API.
Next.js renders the page with the stock data (price, charts, etc.). It might not fetch the AI summary yet (to keep initial load fast).
On the client side, after initial load, a React effect triggers an API call to your /api/analyze-filing?symbol=ABC.
That API route on the server fetches the full text of ABC's latest filing (perhaps from SEC or your cache), then calls OpenAI API with a prompt to summarize it.
The summary comes back, your API route returns it to the client.
The React state updates to display "Summary of last 10-K: ...".
Meanwhile, the user could also add ABC to their watchlist. When they click "Add to Watchlist", your app calls another API route /api/watchlist (POST) with ABC. The server verifies the user (via Supabase auth token), inserts a row into Supabase (watchlist table). Supabase returns the new data, and maybe your client updates the UI to reflect it's added. If you have realtime, the dashboard might automatically show it next time.
If a new filing for ABC comes out the next day, your backend (maybe a scheduled job or just when the user logs in next) fetches it. If you have notifications, you insert a notification "New 10-Q filed for ABC on 2025-08-07". If the user has email alerts on, you send an email as well via your email mechanism.
This interplay shows how each part coordinates. It might seem complex, but each feature can be built and integrated one by one (as we will outline in the step-by-step). The key point: Next.js is the integration layer, Supabase is the data layer, Sanity is the content layer, and other services (financial APIs, AI, Stripe, Gmail) plug in as needed. This modular approach will make your project maintainable and scalable.
Step-by-Step Development Plan
With the architecture in mind, let's break down the development process into a sequence of concrete steps. This will guide you from starting the project to implementing all the major features. The idea is to start small and continually build upon the foundation, ensuring each part works before moving to the next. 1. Set Up the Project Repository: Begin by creating a Git repository (on GitHub or your preferred platform). This will help you track changes and collaborate (even if you're solo, it's good for backup and history). Initialize the repo with a README describing the project. You might want to set up an issue tracker or project board for tasks as you go, but at minimum, have version control in place. 2. Initialize the Next.js App: Use the Next.js official starter to create your project scaffold. Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-next-app@latest --experimental-app finance-webapp
When prompted:
Choose TypeScript (since you listed TS5).
Opt-in to ESLint.
Choose Tailwind CSS if it's offered in the setup (Create Next App can configure Tailwind for you).
Select the src/app (App Router) structure if prompted (in Next 15 this should be default).
This will generate a basic Next.js 15 project with all the necessary config. Verify it runs: npm run dev and open http://localhost:3000 to see the starter page. 3. Integrate Tailwind CSS: If Create Next App didn't automatically set it up (depending on the version, it might), do the following:
Install Tailwind and its peer dependencies: npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest.
Initialize Tailwind config: npx tailwindcss init -p. This adds tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.
In tailwind.config.js, set the content paths to include all your pages and components, for example:
js
Copy
Edit
content: [
  "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
],
This ensures Tailwind scans those files for class names.
Add the Tailwind directives to your global CSS (Next creates a globals.css in src/app). It should contain:
css
Copy
Edit
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Include any additional Tailwind plugins configuration. For instance, to use the typography plugin, first install it: npm install @tailwindcss/typography, then add to tailwind.config.js:
js
Copy
Edit
plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],
Start the dev server and test that Tailwind classes work. You can modify the default page (in src/app/page.tsx) to include some Tailwind styled element (e.g., <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-500">Hello World</h1>) to confirm styling is applied.
4. Set Up ESLint and Prettier: Since ESLint was likely set up by the starter, configure it to your liking. The Next.js starter includes a .eslintrc.json with Next's recommended rules. You can extend it with plugins for Tailwind (there is an ESLint plugin for Tailwind class ordering) or Prettier. Install Prettier and perhaps an ESLint config for it:
npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier
In your ESLint config, add "extends": ["next/core-web-vitals", "prettier"] (the prettier extension turns off rules that conflict with Prettier).
Create a basic .prettierrc (or .prettierrc.json) with your preferences (or none, default is fine).
Now your code will lint and format consistently. You might integrate this into your IDE or add a npm script for linting ("lint": "next lint" is usually present).
5. Connect to Supabase:
Create Supabase Project: Log in to Supabase and create a new project (choose the free tier for now). You’ll get a Project URL and anon API key (find these in Project Settings -> API). Also get the service role key (for using in backend securely if needed, e.g., for Stripe webhooks to bypass RLS).
In your Next.js app, install the Supabase packages: npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs.
Set up environment variables for Supabase. In your local .env file (which should be added to .gitignore):
ini
Copy
Edit
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = your-service-role-key (keep this secret, not exposed to public)
The NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix means those will be available in the browser as well (the anon key is okay to expose, it's designed to be used client-side with RLS to guard data). The service role key should NOT be exposed to the client; you'll only use it in server-side code (like in API routes or Vercel functions) for certain secure operations (e.g., handling Stripe webhooks to update data ignoring RLS).
Initialize Supabase in your app. You can create a utility file src/utils/supabaseClient.ts:
ts
Copy
Edit
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
This client can be used in the browser components. For server-side (like in Server Components or API routes where you might want to use the user's JWT for RLS), Supabase provides helpers. For example, with @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs, you can use createServerComponentClient in a Server Component to get a client that's tied to the user's session. Consult Supabase docs for Next.js SSR for that setup.
Database Schema: Using Supabase's web UI (Table Editor or SQL editor), define the tables you need initially:
profiles table: Supabase by default creates a users table for auth. You can create a profiles table that has id (uuid) primary key that references auth.users.id, plus any extra fields (name, etc.). Supabase's quickstart often does this.
watchlist table: columns: id (uuid), user_id (uuid), symbol (text), maybe created_at (timestamp default now()). Set user_id to reference auth.users.id as a foreign key.
Any other tables for initial needs, e.g., notifications (id, user_id, message, created_at, read boolean), etc. You can add more as you implement features.
Enable RLS: In Supabase, go to each table's settings and enable Row Level Security. By default, with RLS on, no one (except service key) can access data until you create policies. Create policies for the tables:
For watchlist: a simple policy to allow a user to SELECT/INSERT/DELETE on watchlist where user_id = auth.uid(). Supabase has a policy template for "Enable individual access to rows based on user ID". This ensures each user only touches their own watchlist rows
supabase.com
.
Similarly for notifications or others tying to user_id.
For profiles: you might allow each user to select/update their own profile, etc.
Test the setup: Write a small piece of code in Next.js to ensure you can insert and read data. For example, in an API route /api/test-supabase:
ts
Copy
Edit
import { supabase } from '@/utils/supabaseClient';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  const { data: symbols } = await supabase.from('watchlist').select('symbol');
  return NextResponse.json({ symbols });
}
Since no user is signed in yet, this will actually return an empty array or error due to RLS (because there's no auth context in this simple test). You can test an insert with the service role key to bypass RLS:
ts
Copy
Edit
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabaseAdmin = createClient(supabaseUrl, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!);
// ... then supabaseAdmin.from('watchlist').insert({ user_id: someuuid, symbol: 'TEST' });
But a better test is to integrate auth and then try as an authenticated user (which we’ll do in the next step).
6. Implement Authentication (User Accounts): Next.js plus Supabase gives you a few ways to handle auth. We'll outline a straightforward approach:
Auth UI: Decide if you will use Supabase’s prebuilt Auth UI (they have an <Auth> component in @supabase/auth-ui-react library) or build custom forms. A custom approach gives you more control over design.
For custom: create a page or component for sign up / sign in. For example, at src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx (you might have an (auth) layout with simple styling). The form will capture email and password (if using password auth) or just email (if using magic link). On submit, use the Supabase client: await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password }) or the equivalent for magic link or OAuth. Supabase handles the rest (sends magic link email or validates password and returns a session).
After sign-in, Supabase client stores the session in local storage by default. But since you're using Next.js, a better approach is to use the Auth Helpers:
The auth helper provides a SupabaseProvider component or hooks like useUser. You can wrap your app with a provider that keeps track of auth state.
Also configure the Next.js middleware that can route users. For instance, you might protect the /dashboard and other private routes by checking req.cookies for the Supabase token. The auth-helpers-nextjs can inject the user on server-side props or you use a middleware to redirect if not logged in.
Social Login: If you want, configure Google or GitHub OAuth in Supabase (in the Auth settings of Supabase, you can enable OAuth providers). Supabase makes it easy to trigger, e.g., supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' }). If you do this, ensure to add your deployment URL to Supabase auth redirect URLs.
Test the auth flow locally:
Start your app, go to the sign up page, create a user. Check in Supabase Dashboard -> Auth -> Users that the new user is created.
Ensure the user session is reflected in the app (maybe display the user's email or a "Log out" button if logged in). You can use supabase.auth.getUser() to get the current user session on the client.
Implement a logout button (supabase.auth.signOut()).
With an authenticated user, test a database call from the client: e.g., supabase.from('watchlist').select('*'). It should return only that user’s rows (currently none or if you inserted any with that user’s ID). You can also try inserting: supabase.from('watchlist').insert({ symbol: 'AAPL' }) – it should automatically attach user_id if you set up a Postgres function for that, or you include the user_id from user.id. Often, one sets a default value on user_id column to auth.uid() in Postgres so that inserts auto-tag the user (Supabase has a way to do this using their auth.uid() function in default).
This verifies that RLS is working (the user can only manipulate their data).
At this point, you have a basic auth system and a way to store user-specific data. This is a major milestone (your app now can have users and a database). 7. Scaffold the Frontend Pages: Create the basic pages (even if empty) to establish your app’s navigation structure. For instance:
/dashboard (after login, main user page)
/screener (stock screener page)
/stocks/[symbol] (individual stock detail page)
Perhaps /profile (user profile/settings)
If you include content: /blog and /blog/[slug] for articles (using Sanity), or other informational pages.
Next.js App Router allows layouts and nested routes. You might create an app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx that checks for user and includes a navbar, etc., wrapping all authed pages. And an app/(marketing)/layout.tsx for public pages (like a homepage, about, etc., if any). This way you can have separate layouts for logged-in vs not. Also set up a basic navigation menu or sidebar so you can move between Dashboard, Screener, etc., once logged in. At this stage, these pages can be mostly placeholder content (e.g., "Dashboard coming soon"). The goal is to ensure the routing and auth protection works:
Implement a redirect in the dashboard page’s Server Component: if no user session, redirect to /login. You can do this by using the Supabase auth helper in a Server Component or Middleware.
Conversely, if user is logged in, maybe redirect / to /dashboard.
Having the pages in place will make it easier to develop each feature in isolation. 8. Integrate Sanity (if you plan to use it from start): If having a content/blog is within your initial scope:
Run npx sanity@latest init outside of the Next.js project (or inside /sanity subfolder). Choose the option that matches your situation (there might be a prompt for framework; you can choose clean project since you're integrating manually).
Define your Sanity schemas (for example, a post schema with fields: title, slug, body, etc., and maybe an author schema, etc.). This depends on what content you want (you can skip this if the app is purely functional and add content later).
Deploy or host the Sanity Studio. Sanity offers a hosted option (Sanity Studio v3 can be deployed as a static bundle or run locally). For simplicity, you can run it locally when editing content, and use Sanity's APIs to fetch content in production.
In the Next.js app, install the Sanity client libs if not already: npm install @sanity/client @portabletext/react. Configure a Sanity client similar to Supabase:
ts
Copy
Edit
import { createClient } from '@sanity/client';
export const sanityClient = createClient({
  projectId: '<your_project_id>',
  dataset: '<your_dataset>',
  apiVersion: '2023-08-07',
  useCdn: true, // useCdn for faster reads (eventually stale data which is fine for CMS)
});
Create a simple example to test: If you have a dataset with some content, try fetching it. For example:
ts
Copy
Edit
const posts = await sanityClient.fetch('*[_type == "post"][0...1]{ title, slug }');
You can run this in a temporary route or even in getStaticProps if you had a Pages Router page for testing. If data returns, Sanity is hooked up.
Build a simple component to render Portable Text using @portabletext/react. Define serializers for any custom types. This is prepping for when you actually display blog content.
If not focusing on content now, you can skip in-depth Sanity integration. It won't interfere with other parts, it's mostly separate.
9. Stock Data API Integration: Now, focus on the finance-specific core: getting stock data.
Choose an API: For this guide, let's assume you pick a free (or freemium) one to start, like Alpha Vantage (for daily prices and basic info) and maybe Yahoo Finance (unofficial APIs or an NPM package like yahoo-finance2) for supplementary data. Alpha Vantage requires an API key (get one free).
Create a file to centralize API calls, e.g., src/lib/financeApi.ts. In there, implement functions like:
ts
Copy
Edit
const ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY = process.env.ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY;
export async function getQuote(symbol: string) {
  // Call Alpha Vantage quote endpoint
  const url = `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=GLOBAL_QUOTE&symbol=${symbol}&apikey=${ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY}`;
  const res = await fetch(url);
  // Alpha Vantage returns JSON with 'Global Quote' field
  const data = await res.json();
  return data;
}
// Similarly, functions for historical data, etc., or use an SDK if available.
Since calling external APIs directly from components is possible (with fetch in Server Components), you have two patterns:
Server Component Fetching: In app/stocks/[symbol]/page.tsx, you could do:
ts
Copy
Edit
const data = await getQuote(symbol);
during the server render. This is nice because the data is loaded before the page is sent to client. However, if the API is slow, it will delay page load. Also, environment variables can be accessed (like the API key) since it's server-side.
2. API Route: Alternatively, create an API route (e.g., app/api/quote/route.ts that accepts symbol in search params). That route uses getQuote(symbol) and returns JSON. Then your client component can use SWR or a simple useEffect to call /api/quote?symbol=XYZ. This may be necessary for actions triggered client-side (like if user selects a new stock from a list and you want to fetch data without a full page reload). You might use a hybrid: fetch initial data server-side for first paint, and then do client-side fetches for updates or interactions.
Historical Data and Charts: For charts, you likely need historical prices. Alpha Vantage has a TIME_SERIES_DAILY or similar that returns a lot of data. You'd call that and then format for the chart (e.g., array of { date, close } points). This can be heavy (hundreds of points). It's okay to fetch server-side and send to client as part of SSR (the JSON will be in the HTML). Alternatively, fetch on client after initial load if you want to lighten the first load.
Testing: Pick a stock (say AAPL) and test your API call functions (you can use a temporary page or even unit test). Ensure you can get a quote and some historical data. Check the shape of data and plan how to map it to your chart component.
10. Build the Stock Screener Page: This feature allows filtering stocks by criteria:
Basic Implementation First: Start simple with a search by symbol or name. You can later expand with filters.
If you have an API or dataset of all stocks (which can be large), you need a way to filter. Alpha Vantage has a "symbol search" endpoint for company names. Alternatively, you might use an open dataset of tickers (for example, an array of S&P 500 companies) for demonstration.
Implement a search bar on /screener page. When user types, you can call an API route /api/searchStocks?query=.... That route could:
Use a third-party API to search (Alpha Vantage has function=SYMBOL_SEARCH which returns matches).
Or query your own database if you decided to store a list of companies in Supabase (not a bad idea to have a companies table with symbol, name, sector, etc., loaded from a CSV).
Display the results in a table or list. For each result, show key fields (name, symbol, maybe price).
Allow the user to add filters (market cap > X, sector = Y, etc.). This can get complicated: either the API provides a way to filter (some paid ones do), or you pull data for many stocks and filter in memory. For an MVP, you might limit to filtering within a known index or list (like "filter within S&P 500 companies by these criteria", where you have data for those 500). This could involve importing a static list or making multiple API calls (which is slow).
Given the complexity, perhaps provide a few preset screens (like "Top Gainers", "High Dividend Stocks", etc.) by hitting specific endpoints or static data. Many finance APIs have some precomputed lists.
UI: Make it so the user can select a stock from the results to view more details (link to /stocks/[symbol]). Also, if logged in, maybe each result has a button "Add to Watchlist". Implement that by calling your Supabase (e.g., an API route or directly via Supabase JS from the client) to insert into watchlist table. Since you have Supabase client on frontend with the user's session, you can do: supabase.from('watchlist').insert({ symbol }) and the RLS will attach user_id if you set up a function, or you include user_id (you have it from user.id). Confirm that works: the row should appear in DB with that user.
The screener, being interactive, will mostly be client-side dynamic (lots of state, etc.), so you might not do much SSR here except maybe server-fetch a default list. It’s fine for this page to be a client component after initial load.
11. Develop the Stock Details Page (/stocks/[symbol]):
This is where you integrate many features for a single stock:
Server-side rendering: Fetch the basic stock data and perhaps some recent news or company info on the server and pass to the page. For instance:
ts
Copy
Edit
// Inside page.tsx for [symbol]
export const revalidate = 60; // (if you want ISR caching for 60 seconds)
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) { ... } // for SEO, maybe use company name in title
const stockData = await getQuote(symbol);
const profileData = ... // maybe company profile like sector, CEO etc., if API provides
return (
   <StockPage symbol={symbol} stock={stockData} profile={profileData} />
)
By doing this server-side, the user sees some data immediately (no loading spinner for main data).
Chart: Integrate the chart library (Recharts or others) to display historical trend. For example, fetch historical prices in the server component as well (or you can fetch on client, either works). Pass the array of prices to a Chart component (which can be a client component if it needs to use DOM).
If using Recharts, you can make <Chart data={priceData} /> a client component (since Recharts might depend on window). The data can be passed as a prop from the server component.
Render a line chart of closing prices. Add X/Y axes, tooltips, etc. Ensure to format dates nicely (perhaps use date-fns or moment to format the x-axis).
Company Info: Show some fundamental info like market cap, P/E, etc., if available from an API. Many APIs have an endpoint for company overview (Alpha Vantage has one for example). Fetch that and display in a sidebar or header.
AI Filing Analysis: This is the advanced part:
On page load, you might not want to automatically fetch a summary (to save on API usage or time). Instead, you could show a button or section "AI Analysis of Latest SEC Filing".
When the user clicks or expands that section, trigger a fetch (client-side) to your /api/analyze-filing?symbol=XYZ.
Implement /api/analyze-filing to do: find the latest annual or quarterly report for the company. You could use the SEC API: e.g., in the company's submissions JSON, look for the most recent filing of type "10-K" or "10-Q". Get the accession number or document link.
Fetch the text of that filing. The SEC provides the full text in HTML (which you might need to strip to plain text or at least extract the main sections). There is a lot of boilerplate, so maybe focus on specific sections like "Risk Factors" or "Business Overview" by searching for headings in the text.
Call the AI API with a prompt to summarize those sections or the whole document (careful with token limits – possibly summarize section by section or have a very targeted prompt).
Receive the summary result (e.g., a few paragraphs).
Return that in the response.
On the client, show a loading spinner while it's processing, then display the summary nicely (perhaps in a styled blockquote or info box). Maybe use Tailwind Typography to style it.
Optionally, you can cache this summary in your database so that subsequent requests for the same filing use the cached result (to avoid hitting AI API repeatedly). E.g., have a table filing_summaries keyed by filing ID and store the summary text.
Because this is an expensive operation, you might restrict it to certain users (maybe only logged-in users, or only premium users if you monetize that feature).
Watchlist Integration: If the user is logged in, show a button "Add to Watchlist" (if not already in their watchlist). This button uses Supabase client to insert the symbol into watchlist (similar to what you did on screener results). You can also indicate if it's already added (you can load the user’s watchlist symbols in the background or as part of the page data).
News (optional): You might include a news feed for the company (some APIs provide recent news by symbol). This can be an RSS feed or a news API. If available, you can show headlines with links. This would be another external API integration (e.g., Finnhub has a news endpoint).
Testing: Try it out with a couple symbols (perhaps large ones with easily available data like AAPL, MSFT). Ensure the page shows all pieces and that the AI summary works (if using OpenAI, test with a smaller prompt or a known small filing to not burn tokens too fast during dev). This page will be one of the most data-heavy, so optimize where you can (maybe use Promise.all on server to fetch multiple API data in parallel, etc.). Also handle errors gracefully (if API fails, show a message).
12. Dashboard Page Implementation: Now that you have the ability to add to watchlist and view stock details, create a personalized dashboard using those:
On /dashboard, when a user is logged in, you want to display an overview:
Perhaps list their watchlist stocks and current prices. You can retrieve the watchlist symbols from Supabase easily (server-side, use the user's JWT to select from watchlist where user_id = current user). Because of RLS, you could even do it client-side with Supabase JS, but server-side is better to deliver content on first paint.
Example: in dashboard/page.tsx (server component), do:
ts
Copy
Edit
const { data: watchlist } = await supabaseServer.from('watchlist').select('symbol');
// supabaseServer here is a server-side client with auth, as set up by auth-helpers.
const symbols = watchlist.map(w => w.symbol);
For each symbol, you need the current price (and maybe change %). You have a couple of options:
Call your own API route or function to get quotes for all those symbols. You could batch request an API if it supports batch (some do allow multiple symbols in one query). If not, you may have to do multiple fetches. An alternative is to use a community package like yahoo-finance2 which can fetch multiple quotes in one call.
Since this is server-side, you could parallelize using Promise.all for multiple symbols. But be mindful of rate limits.
Simpler: if watchlist is small, just loop and fetch one by one (Alpha Vantage has 5 requests/min limit on free tier, which could be an issue if user has many).
Once you have quote data for each, present them in a table: Symbol, Price, Change%. Perhaps color the text green/red based on change.
Make each symbol clickable (link to its detail page).
You can also show a mini chart for each (sparkline for the day) if you want to be fancy, but that can come later.
If you implemented notifications (e.g., stored some in DB), show recent notifications like "Your alert for GOOGL was triggered" or "New filing for XYZ" with timestamps.
If the Gmail integration is done and user connected their Gmail, you might show a section like "Emails from your broker" or whatever the use-case is (this could be a list of parsed email subjects).
Real-time Updates: It’s a dashboard, so ideally some parts update without full refresh:
For stock prices, you could use a client-side polling to refresh prices every X seconds for the watchlist. Or open a WebSocket to a free service (some exist for a few tickers). If using Supabase’s realtime, you'd have to be inserting price updates into the DB which is probably not happening unless you set up a cron job to do so (which might be overkill).
The simplest approach: use useSWR or a custom hook to refetch quotes every minute or on focus revalidate. SWR can call an API route that returns latest quotes for the list.
For notifications, if using Supabase realtime on the notifications table, you can subscribe on component mount and update state when a new one comes.
AI Summary Integration: Maybe show an AI summary snippet on dashboard, like "AI highlights: Company X's revenue grew 10% last quarter..." for something the user is watching. This is optional and could be part of premium features.
Ensure the dashboard is performant. If a user has, say, 20 stocks in watchlist and you fetch all data server-side on each load, it could be slow with certain APIs. You might implement caching:
Use Next.js Incremental Static Regeneration (revalidate property) to cache the whole page for, say, 30 seconds to 1 minute (so hitting dashboard frequently doesn't always call APIs if data is fresh).
Or cache individual API results in memory or a KV store. This might be over-optimization at first; measure and adjust later.
13. Notifications & Alerts (Enhancement): If you want to implement a full alerting system:
Price Alerts: Allow user to set an alert like "if AAPL drops below $150, notify me". You’d need a UI to input these criteria and store them (e.g., alerts table with user_id, symbol, condition (<, >, =), target price). To check them, you'd need a background job that periodically checks current prices against conditions. Without a backend server running 24/7, you might use Supabase Edge Functions (they allow deploying serverless functions in Deno environment) and Supabase’s Scheduler (if available) to run it every X minutes. Or use an external cron (like a GitHub Action or Cloud Function) to trigger your Next.js API endpoint at intervals. When an alert condition is met, you create a notification row and possibly send an email. This is a bit involved, so for MVP you might skip actual alert triggering and just have the UI in place.
SEC Filing Alerts: Similar concept: "notify me if a new filing for company X is available". The SEC has RSS feeds for filings or you can poll the API. This could be done daily. If implementing, consider using a scheduled job that checks the latest filing date from SEC for companies in users’ watchlists and compares to last known. Again, if new, create a notification.
Implementing the actual sending of email notifications: If you decide to send emails for alerts, set up an email service. Since you mentioned Gmail, you could use a Gmail SMTP via Nodemailer as a quick solution: e.g., use a throwaway Gmail account to send emails to users. But in production, it’s better to use something like SendGrid (you can get a free tier) and send via API or SMTP. Whichever you use, you’d call it in your alert checking job.
In your app UI, let the user manage their alerts (view existing, delete, etc.). This ties into the profile or dashboard page.
14. Payment Integration (Stripe): If you plan to have premium features (like the AI analysis or unlimited watchlist, etc.), integrate Stripe for payments:
Decide on your product/pricing. Perhaps a monthly subscription for "Premium".
In Stripe dashboard, create a Product (e.g., "Premium Plan") and a Price (e.g., $10/month).
In your Next.js app, install Stripe SDK for the backend: npm install stripe.
Create an API route for checkout, e.g., app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts. In it, use the Stripe library with your secret key (from env) to create a Checkout Session:
ts
Copy
Edit
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, { apiVersion: '2022-11-15' });
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { userId } = await getUserFromSupabaseAuth(req); // you'll need to figure out the user from the request or session
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    customer_email: userEmail, // or if you have a Stripe customer ID from previous use, use that
    line_items: [{ price: 'price_12345', quantity: 1 }], // use the Price ID from Stripe
    mode: 'subscription',
    success_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/payments/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/payments/cancel`,
    metadata: { userId }
  });
  return NextResponse.json({ url: session.url });
}
The above is conceptual; adapt to your needs. It creates a session and returns the URL to the client.
On the client side, when user clicks "Upgrade", you call this API (maybe using fetch or a custom action) to get the session URL, then do window.location.href = sessionURL or use Stripe.js to redirect.
Create a page to handle post-checkout success (Stripe will redirect to your success_url). In that page, you can fetch the session by ID (using Stripe API with secret key, probably in an API route that the page calls or via useEffect). Verify payment status and show a message. However, do not trust the redirect alone for provisioning – always use webhooks.
Webhook: In app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts (for example), set up Stripe webhook handling. You’ll need to configure the webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard to call your endpoint (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe). Use the Stripe library to verify the signature (Stripe provides a signing secret for webhooks).
ts
Copy
Edit
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const sig = req.headers.get('stripe-signature');
  const body = await req.text(); // raw body needed
  let event;
  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig!, process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!);
  } catch (err) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 400 });
  }
  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    const session = event.data.object as Stripe.Checkout.Session;
    const userId = session.metadata?.userId;
    // Mark user as premium in Supabase
    await supabaseAdmin.from('profiles').update({ is_premium: true }).eq('id', userId);
  }
  // handle other event types like subscription updated if needed
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true }, { status: 200 });
}
Note: In Next 13 app, you might need to disable body parsing for this route or handle as above (using req.text()).
Now your app knows who is premium. You can use that to unlock features. For example, store in the profiles table an is_premium boolean (as done above). The Supabase JWT can include custom claims but easier is just to query it when needed.
In your UI, check the profile from Supabase (or Supabase auth session might have a claim) to conditionally show premium features. E.g., on stock page: if not premium, blur or block the AI summary with a prompt to upgrade.
Test the whole flow in Stripe test mode. Use test card numbers to simulate a payment. Ensure the webhook updates the DB. Check that premium-only sections become accessible after upgrading (you might need to force refresh the user’s session or data after the webhook since the user might be on the site already – maybe listen to the success redirect and then fetch profile or simply ask them to re-login or something to get updated status, depending on implementation).
15. Final Polishing:
By now, you have implemented core features. Go through and ensure error handling is in place: e.g., what if an API call fails? Show an error message or fallback data. Handle loading states in the UI so the user knows something is happening (especially for AI calls or any slower operations).
UI/UX pass: Style the app consistently. Use Tailwind to create a nice layout, spacing, and perhaps add a theme (maybe dark mode toggle using Tailwind's dark class, if desired). Ensure it's responsive (Tailwind's utility classes make it easy to adjust for mobile).
Add any branding or personal touches (like a logo, which you can put in the navbar).
If you have time, implement some nice-to-haves: e.g., sorting in the screener results, pagination if needed, maybe caching of API results to avoid hitting limits (could use a simple in-memory cache or use Supabase to store some cached data).
Analytics & Monitoring: Integrate an analytics tool to understand usage (even simple Google Analytics or Vercel Analytics). And set up error monitoring with Sentry (it's free for small usage). This will help if something goes wrong in production.
Write a README for your repo explaining how to set up the project, env vars needed, etc., in case you collaborate or deploy.
16. Deployment:
Push your code to GitHub.
On Vercel (assuming you use it), create a new project and import your GitHub repo. Vercel should auto-detect it's a Next.js app and set up accordingly.
In Vercel's project settings, add the environment variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, ALPHAVANTAGE_KEY (or other API keys), STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL (which should be your Vercel domain or custom domain, used for redirects), and any others (Sanity project info, etc.). Mark the sensitive ones as secret (Vercel does by default).
Set up your domain or use the default Vercel one for testing.
Set up Stripe webhook to point to the Vercel deployment URL for /api/webhooks/stripe.
Deploy the app. Vercel will build and give you a live link.
Post-Deploy: Test everything on the deployed version:
Sign up a new user, add to watchlist, ensure database writes work from deployed environment.
Test pages and API routes (some issues might arise only in prod due to env or case-sensitivity in imports, etc.).
Run through the Stripe checkout in test mode on the deployed site (you might use Stripe test mode still – you can simulate by actually deploying with test keys).
If Gmail integration exists, try connecting a Gmail account (make sure your OAuth callback URL is correct for prod).
Monitor the logs (Vercel provides function logs) for any errors, fix them if any.
17. Security Review: Before considering it done, do a sweep focusing on security:
Check that no secret keys are exposed in the client-side JS (aside from the intended public ones). Open dev tools on the app and search the sources for things like your Supabase service key or Stripe secret – they should not be there. Only public anon keys or publishable keys should appear.
Try to access API routes or pages as an unauthorized user to ensure your protections work (e.g., try to fetch /api/watchlist without auth token, it should fail or return nothing; try to go to /dashboard when not logged in, it should redirect).
Consider using a tool like OWASP ZAP or an online scanner on your deployed site to catch common vulnerabilities.
Ensure all dependencies are updated to latest patch versions (run npm audit and address any high vulnerabilities).
Because this is a finance app, also think about privacy: have a clear privacy policy if you have users, especially since you might be handling email data or such. Even if it's a small project, it's good practice.
18. Iterative Improvements:
Now that the core is built, gather feedback (from testers or your own use). You might discover new feature ideas or refinements:
UI improvements, more filters in screener, caching strategies to improve speed, additional data on stock page (maybe financial ratios, graphs of revenue, etc., which could be fetched from financial statements).
Perhaps integrating a forum or commenting for users to discuss stocks (that would need another service or a new Supabase table for comments).
If Gmail integration is there, maybe expand it to also parse certain emails and show insights (like "Found 5 trade confirmation emails, click here to see them").
Add mobile support if not already (Tailwind makes layouts responsive, but double-check usability on mobile).
Monitor performance: Next.js and Vercel provide analytics. If any page is slow (maybe the stock page with many API calls), consider adding caching or moving some calls client-side to not block first paint.
Ensure scalability: e.g., if your user base grew, would anything break limits? (Supabase can handle quite a bit on free, but heavy usage of external APIs might hit rate limits). You might implement a simple caching layer or queue for AI requests if needed.
Plan these improvements and tackle them one by one, deploying often to catch issues early.
By following these steps, you start from a skeleton and gradually layer on functionality: auth → basic data fetching → core features (screener, stock page, AI, etc.) → polish → deploy. At each step, test thoroughly. This incremental approach ensures that you always have a working app at each stage (even if some features are stubbed or basic), and you can demo progress or roll back if something goes wrong. Let’s also ensure any missing prompts to the user: It looks like we have enough info now. If any uncertainty remains (like which stock API or exact AI approach), you could implement one choice and document that the system can be swapped out easily if requirements change (for instance, switching from Alpha Vantage to a more real-time API if needed). Now, given the comprehensive plan above, you should have a clear path forward.
Security Considerations
Financial applications can be attractive targets and also must maintain user trust. We touched on some security aspects during setup; here we’ll summarize key security considerations and best practices for this project:
Protecting API Keys & Secrets: All sensitive keys (Supabase service role, Stripe secret, API keys for external services, OpenAI key, etc.) should be kept out of client-side code. Use environment variables and do not expose them in any frontend bundle. We already set this up with dotenv and Next.js’ env system. In production, ensure those vars are configured and not leaking. Version control should ignore any .env files. This way, secrets are only on the server, and the client interacts through your protected endpoints
stackoverflow.com
.
Authentication Security: Rely on Supabase’s tested auth for handling passwords (if used) and OAuth. Supabase will handle password hashing and verification. Use HTTPS everywhere (Vercel provides HTTPS by default) so that credentials and tokens are not sent in plain text. The Supabase JS library uses secure cookies or JWT for sessions – prefer using the secure cookie mode (Supabase Auth Helpers can set a HttpOnly cookie with the token on sign-in). This prevents XSS from stealing JWTs. Also configure redirect URLs properly in Supabase for magic links/OAuth to prevent phishing.
Authorization (Access Control): Implement fine-grained access control using Supabase RLS and also checks in your code:
Every Supabase query from the client uses the user's JWT, so RLS policies will automatically apply and prevent data leaks (e.g., one user fetching another’s watchlist)
supabase.com
. Test those policies.
On the Next.js side, for API routes that perform sensitive tasks (like creating a Stripe session or doing an AI analysis), verify the request’s authenticity. For example, if an API route expects a user to be logged in, either require a Supabase JWT in the Authorization header or (easier with Next 13) use the server-side Supabase client which pulls user from cookies. Don’t trust any data coming from client without validation.
Ensure premium features are properly gated (both in UI and backend). E.g., even if the UI hides an AI summary for free users, a determined user could try to call the API route directly – so that route should check the user’s premium status on the server before proceeding.
Input Validation & Sanitization: Most of your inputs are search queries or form fields:
For search queries or stock symbols, use server-side validation to avoid things like SQL injection or unwanted API calls. Since you use Supabase and parameterized queries or external API calls, SQL injection risk is low (Supabase client handles it and external APIs treat query as string). Just ensure you don’t directly interpolate user input into any database queries without parameterization.
If you accept any rich text input from users (not clear if you do; maybe not in this project aside from possibly code editor input), sanitize it on output. We have Remark/Rehype for markdown which we should configure with sanitization if any user content is rendered.
The Sanity content (if any) is authored by you/trusted sources, so it's okay. Portable Text will not include dangerous scripts by default, and you’re using Sanity’s tools to render, which are safe.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): React is resilient to XSS by default because it escapes strings. However, be cautious when inserting HTML manually. For instance:
If you use dangerouslySetInnerHTML anywhere (like for rendering HTML from the SEC filings or emails), you must sanitize that HTML (remove scripts, unwanted iframes, etc.). There are libraries for HTML sanitization (DOMPurify, etc.).
The AI summary text from OpenAI should be plain text (OpenAI might return some markdown or code fences sometimes, but generally it’s text – you could render it as text or sanitize if you render as HTML).
Maintain Content Security Policy if possible. You might configure a strict CSP via Next.js headers (e.g., only allow scripts from your domain and known APIs). This reduces risk if somehow an XSS injection happened – CSP could mitigate impact.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): For Next.js API routes, if you rely on HttpOnly cookies for auth (Supabase can set a sb-access-token cookie), be aware of CSRF. Supabase’s approach for its own endpoints uses a double-submit cookie technique. For your custom API routes, since most are protected by requiring a valid auth token (which an attacker’s browser wouldn’t have unless the user is logged in and not protected), the risk is lower. However, you might still implement CSRF protection for any state-changing POST requests. You can use packages like csurf or rely on SameSite cookies. Vercel's serverless functions don’t maintain server state, so traditional CSRF tokens need to be stored client-side and validated. At least ensure cookies like Supabase’s are SameSite=Lax or Strict (Supabase’s auth cookies default to Lax which helps prevent CSRF on cross-site contexts).
Rate Limiting & Abuse: Since some features call external APIs (which might have rate limits or cost implications), you should guard against abuse:
Implement basic rate limiting on certain API routes (e.g., don’t allow a user to trigger the AI summary 100 times in a minute, or search too rapidly). You can use an in-memory store or a tool like Upstash Redis with a rate limiting library. Even a simple check by IP (though IP-based might hurt if behind NAT or if many users from one office) or by user ID if logged in.
Stripe and Supabase are robust to handle many calls, but your free tier API keys (Alpha Vantage, etc.) could be exhausted. Consider caching frequent data (like if multiple users ask for the same stock data, cache it for short time).
Also, ensure file uploads (if any in future) are constrained (Supabase Storage can handle permissions). For now, no file upload feature, but if adding (like user profile pic), use Supabase Storage with RLS.
Secure Connections and Data: Everything should be transmitted over HTTPS. Ensure your Supabase URL is https://... and not using rest API over http (Supabase will enforce TLS anyway). The same with Sanity and Stripe (always https endpoints).
Data at rest: Supabase encrypts data at rest (since it’s managed Postgres) and Sanity does as well for their store. But if you were self-hosting the DB, you’d want to enable encryption on the volume. Just a note that managed services handle a lot of this.
Backups: Rely on Supabase's backup (they have daily backups on free plan too) and Sanity’s history. It’s good to have for disaster recovery.
Monitoring and Alerts: Set up alerts for unusual activity. For instance, Supabase can send email on sudden spike in requests or auth attempts (not sure if built-in, but you can monitor usage in dashboard). Stripe will email you on suspicious activity on payments. Having Sentry (or Vercel’s built-in logging) can alert you to spikes in errors which might indicate an attack or malfunction.
Third-Party Script Safety: You're including some third-party scripts via packages (Stripe.js, perhaps Google APIs). These are generally trusted, but be mindful of any script tags you include. For example, Stripe.js is loaded from Stripe’s CDN; that's necessary for checkout. Make sure to include it via the official method and not some unknown source. If you use any ad or analytics scripts, consider their impact on user privacy and security.
Testing Security: Consider writing some tests or using online scanners for:
SQL injection (try entering ' OR 1=1 in inputs – should not break anything or expose data).
XSS (try inputting <script>alert(1)</script> in a search or any text field that might display back – it should ideally render innocuously or be escaped).
Authentication bypass: ensure protected API routes indeed require auth (if using Supabase JS on client, it includes the token automatically; on server, use the session or require a header).
If you implement the Gmail integration, security there is crucial: store refresh tokens encrypted or in a secure vault if possible. Google tokens are OAuth, so they expire – make sure you handle refresh securely. Also, limit the Gmail scope (no need for send if you only read, etc.)
dev.to
. And provide a way to revoke access (the user could remove the app from their Google account too).
By adhering to these practices, you significantly reduce the security risks. As a rule of thumb, always assume someone might try to misuse your app and code defensively. Given that finance is involved, users might be extra sensitive about their data (even if it's just watchlists or email content). Being transparent in a privacy policy about what you do with data (and ensuring you actually protect it) will go a long way.
This comprehensive plan covers the selection and setup of your tech stack, clarifies the project scope with key questions, outlines a detailed step-by-step path to build the application, and highlights important security considerations. By following these steps and tips, you should be well-equipped to start developing your finance web app with confidence. Good luck, and happy coding!
