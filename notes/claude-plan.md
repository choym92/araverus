Technology Stack Refinement
Frontend Layer:

Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript 5

Tailwind CSS 4 (recommended over Styled Components for performance)

Framer Motion 12 for animations

Recharts for initial charting (upgrade path to React Financial Charts)

Backend Infrastructure:

Supabase for database, auth, and storage

Python FastAPI microservice for AI processing

LangChain for RAG pipeline orchestration

OpenAI GPT models for text generation

External Integrations:

Alpha Vantage (MVP) → Polygon.io (scaling)

SendGrid for email notifications

Stripe for payments (Phase 3)

📋 Project Management Strategy
Phased Development Approach
Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-10)

Core Hypothesis: Individual investors will find value in AI-driven SEC filing summaries.

Scope: User auth + Stock search + AI Risk Factors analysis + Simple dashboard.

Success Metrics: User signups, feature usage, qualitative feedback.

Phase 2: Fast Follow (Months 3-6)

Advanced stock screener with filters.

Expanded AI analysis (MD&A sections).

Watchlists and notifications.

Basic historical charting.

Phase 3: Monetization (Months 6+)

Real-time data streaming.

Stripe subscription model.

Advanced charting with technical indicators.

Gmail integration (deferred due to security complexity).

Domain Expertise: Specialized financial document analysis that general tools can't match.

Real-time Data Integration: Live market data combined with AI insights.

Regulatory Focus: Deep understanding of SEC filing structures and compliance.

User-Centric Dashboard: Personalized financial intelligence vs. generic code assistance.

Immediate Action Plan
Start Today:

Initialize the Next.js project.

Set up Supabase project and secure your environment variables.

Create GitHub repository with proper branch protection rules.

Design your MVP database schema focusing on users and watchlists tables.

This Week:

Build the authentication flow.

Set up deployment pipeline with Vercel for continuous deployment.

Create basic UI components using Tailwind for rapid prototyping.

Research and select your SEC data API (recommend starting with SEC's free EDGAR API).

Risk Mitigation Strategy
Technical Risks:

AI Cost Management: Implement usage tracking and rate limiting early.

Data Quality: Validate SEC filing parsing thoroughly.

Performance: Monitor API response times and implement caching.

Business Risks:

Market Validation: Survey potential users early and often.

Regulatory Compliance: Consult legal counsel for financial data aggregation.

Competitive Response: Focus on unique AI + financial domain expertise.

Success Metrics Framework
User Engagement: 70%+ of users request at least one AI summary.

Data Quality: <5% error rate in SEC filing retrieval.

Performance: <3 second load times for AI summaries.

User Satisfaction: >4.0/5.0 rating in early user feedback.

🏁 Your Clear Path Forward
You have a solid foundation, a grasp of the technical complexity, and a clear market opportunity.

Critical Next Actions
Set up Supabase project (30 minutes) to unlock authentication and database.

Create your first API endpoint for stock search to validate your architecture.

Build a simple SEC filing fetcher to prove your core concept.

Deploy to Vercel to test your full pipeline.
