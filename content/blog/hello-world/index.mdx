# Welcome to MDX Blogging

This is your first MDX blog post! MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your markdown files, making it perfect for technical blogs.

## Why MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. Here are some benefits:

- **Component Integration**: Use React components directly in your content
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Performance**: Static generation for blazing fast pages
- **Developer Experience**: Write in your favorite editor (like Obsidian!)

## Code Examples

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
function Welcome({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## Using Custom Components

You can even use custom components like this Figure component:

<Figure src="/blog/hello-world/example.png" caption="An example image with caption" />

## Lists and Formatting

### Ordered List
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List
