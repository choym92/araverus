excerpt: "I’m adding a Finance tab to this site: a simple, automated signals board that blends RSI/MACD with fundamentals—built for swing and long-term investors."
---

I’m pointing this blog in a clear direction: **a practical Finance tab** on this site that tracks a small watchlist and labels each ticker as **Early Buy, Confirmed Buy, Early Sell, Confirmed Sell, or Neutral**.

No day-trading noise. No hype. Just a daily (or weekly) pass that turns data into simple, explainable signals.

---

## Why this, why now

- Most of us can’t sit at screens all day.  
- Swing + long-term investing fits real life.  
- A once-per-day (or week) script can do the watching and ping us when something actually changed.

I’ll keep the writing short and the tooling boring and reliable—the same way I approach coding in the **araverus** repo.

## What I’m building in the Finance tab

**Signals board**  
  A compact table: Ticker • Price • RSI • MACD • Label (Early/Confirmed Buy/Sell/Neutral) • Notes.

**Trend alignment**  
  Weekly trend for context, daily for timing. Monthly is reserved for slow fundamentals.

**Fundamentals overlay**  
  Quality (growth, margins, ROIC) and Valuation (DCF or simple multiples).  
  If quality is low or valuation is stretched, buy signals get down-weighted.

**Explanations, not magic**  
  Each label shows the exact checks that fired: “RSI < 30 on daily, MACD crossed up, price > 50-DMA.”

**Alerts**  
  Only on state changes (e.g., Neutral → Confirmed Buy). Daily email summary optional.

## How it will work (high level)

1) **Data in**: daily candles for price; periodic fundamentals on earnings.  
2) **Compute**: RSI, MACD, moving averages; update quality/valuation scores.  
3) **Decide**: early vs confirmed rules; fundamentals adjust conviction.  
4) **Publish**: write a small JSON file the site reads for the Finance tab.  
5) **Notify**: send an alert only when a label changes.

Automation runs once per day after the close. Weekly confirms run on Fridays.

## What you’ll see on the page

- A watchlist board with current labels and confidence.
- A tiny “Why” panel per ticker (one or two sentences).
- A fundamentals mini-card (quality/valuation at a glance).
- A changelog of label flips (so we don’t forget context).

I’ll start with AAPL for clarity, then expand to a small basket.

## Roadmap for posts (short reads)

1) **The label system**: Early vs Confirmed, and why it reduces false starts.  
2) **The fundamentals overlay**: when to trust a buy, when to wait.  
3) **Apple, end-to-end**: one page that ties it together.  
4) **Backtests (sanity only)**: did the rules behave as expected?  
5) **Shipping the Finance tab**: wiring it into this site and setting alerts.

Each post will be 5–7 minutes, tops.

## How you can help

Feel free to email me on any imporvements or metrics you want me to utilize.

I’ll keep the system simple, explainable, and easy to verify.  
When the first version lands, you’ll find it under **Finance** in the navigation.
