Automated Stock Signal Tracker: Combining Technical & Fundamental Analysis (Apple Example)
Long-Term vs. Swing Trading (Avoiding Day Trading)

Focusing on swing trading and long-term investing is wise if you cannot commit to full-time trading. Day trading demands constant monitoring and very rapid decision-making – it essentially requires your full attention during market hours and often becomes a full-time job
investopedia.com
. Swing trading (holding positions for days or weeks) is much more manageable alongside other work, since you can analyze charts after market hours and place trades less frequently. In fact, swing trading can be integrated into a part-time routine, whereas day trading typically requires a full-time commitment

investopedia.com
. By avoiding intraday trades, you also avoid much of the noise and stress; instead, you’ll use daily or weekly data for decisions. This means our automation tool can run once per day (or week) to send alerts or update a dashboard, rather than needing to execute dozens of trades per day in real-time. In summary, a mix of long-term investing and swing trading is practical – it lets you profit from medium-term price “swings” and long-term growth without the intense time commitment of day trading

Choosing the Right Timeframes (Daily vs. Weekly vs. Monthly Signals)

For high-probability trade signals, the timeframe of analysis is crucial. Longer time frames (weekly or monthly charts) tend to produce more reliable signals by filtering out short-term market noise
investopedia.com
. Weekly patterns help “smooth out” daily volatility, making it easier to spot true trends and key support/resistance levels
investopedia.com
. In contrast, daily charts will generate more frequent signals but include more noise and false moves. A good strategy is to combine multiple timeframes: use weekly charts to define the broader trend and key levels, then use daily charts to time entries and exits. This way, you align your swing trades with the long-term trend (improving win probability) while still getting timely entry points. For example, if the weekly trend for a stock is bullish (rising price, positive weekly momentum) but the daily chart shows a temporary pullback, that pullback on the daily could be an ideal entry within the long-term uptrend. Research supports this approach – weekly charts carve out more reliable highs/lows than noisy intraday moves
investopedia.com
, and focusing on higher time frames helps avoid being whipsawed by high-frequency trading volatility
investopedia.com
. Monthly data is generally used for long-term fundamental tracking (e.g. checking monthly or quarterly performance) rather than trading signals, since monthly technical signals are very slow. So, our tool will primarily analyze daily data for swing trade signals (with alerts perhaps on a daily closing basis) and weekly data for trend confirmation, while keeping an eye on monthly/quarterly fundamentals updates for the long-term picture.

Technical Indicators and Entry/Exit Signals (RSI & MACD)

To identify early entries, confirmation entries, and sell signals, we will leverage technical indicators like RSI and MACD, along with price trend analysis. Here’s how to use these tools in the system:

Relative Strength Index (RSI) – a momentum oscillator that measures how overbought or oversold a stock is. RSI ranges from 0 to 100. Traditionally, RSI > 70 indicates an overbought condition and RSI < 30 indicates oversold
investopedia.com
. An oversold RSI (below 30) can signal an early entry opportunity – it suggests the stock has fallen too fast and may be due for a rebound. For example, if Apple’s RSI dips under 30, it means traders have been selling heavily and the stock is “oversold,” often leading value investors to start looking for a bottom. However, oversold alone is an early (riskier) signal – the stock could remain weak for a while
thereformedbroker.com
. Conversely, RSI > 70 (overbought) can warn that a rally is overstretched, often an early warning to take profits or tighten stop-losses. Many traders use RSI crossings as triggers: for instance, when a stock’s RSI rises back above 30 from below, it confirms that momentum is turning up off oversold levels (a potential buy signal)
investopedia.com
. Likewise, if RSI falls back below 70 from above, it confirms momentum turning down from an overbought peak – a signal to sell or at least be cautious
investopedia.com
.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) – a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of price. The MACD line (difference between 12-day and 26-day EMA by default) oscillates around a centerline (zero), and a signal line (usually 9-day EMA of MACD) is used to trigger signals. A classic MACD bullish crossover (when the MACD line crosses above the signal line) is a confirmation entry signal – it indicates the stock’s momentum is shifting from negative to positive
investopedia.com
. Traders often interpret a MACD crossover upward as a buy confirmation, especially if it occurs from below the zero line (signaling a move from downtrend toward uptrend)
investopedia.com
investopedia.com
. Conversely, a bearish crossover (MACD line crossing below the signal line) suggests momentum turning downward, a potential sell confirmation. In our system, we can use MACD to confirm an early RSI signal: for example, if RSI has been oversold (early sign) and then the MACD line crosses above its signal line, that crossover would confirm the trend reversal, giving higher confidence to enter a long trade
investopedia.com
. This two-step confirmation helps filter out false alarms – an oversold RSI by itself might bounce briefly and then continue falling, but if it’s accompanied by a positive MACD crossover, the probability of a sustained move up is higher
investopedia.com
.

Price Trend and Patterns – In addition to RSI and MACD, it’s helpful to incorporate basic trend analysis for confirmation. For instance, you might require the stock’s price to break above a certain moving average or resistance level to validate an “early entry.” Many traders use the 50-day or 200-day moving average as trend indicators. Our tool can check conditions like “price closes above the 50-day MA” as a simple trend confirmation. For a concrete example, if Apple had been in a downtrend and then its price closes back above the 50-day moving average after an oversold RSI, that event could mark a confirmation entry (the downtrend might be ending). Similarly, chart patterns or support/resistance levels can be integrated: an “early entry” might trigger when price bounces off a known support line during an oversold condition, whereas a full confirmation might be declared only after the price breaks a resistance or forms a higher high. Incorporating volume could further strengthen signals (e.g. heavy volume on a bounce adds credibility). These price-based rules ensure the technical signals are aligned with actual market behavior (not just indicator math).

Sell Signals – The tool should also flag when to exit or reduce positions. A common approach is symmetric to entries: RSI > 70 (overbought) often precedes a pullback
investopedia.com
, so an overbought reading can serve as an early warning to consider selling or at least tightening risk management. The confirmation of a sell could be a MACD bearish crossover or a breakdown below a moving average or trendline. For example, if Apple’s RSI has pushed above 70 (very strong recent rally) and then a few days later the MACD crosses down below its signal line, that combination is a strong sell signal – momentum has flipped downward after an overbought peak
investopedia.com
. Our system would mark that as a “sell” alert (perhaps indicating it’s a good time to take profits or tighten stops). Likewise, if a stock’s price breaks below a key support or a trailing stop level, the system can issue a sell alert. In practice, a prudent strategy is to scale out: maybe sell part of the position on the early warning (overbought RSI) and fully exit on the confirmed signal (MACD crossover down or major support break). This way, you lock in gains and protect against a reversal. The specific rules can be customized, but the principle is to use RSI and MACD in tandem to time exits just as we time entries, and to respect significant technical levels (e.g. if Apple fell below its 200-day moving average on heavy volume, that would be a bearish sign to exit a long-term position).

In summary, RSI will be our early indicator of extreme conditions and potential turning points, and MACD (along with price trend criteria) will be our confirmation indicator to validate that a true trend reversal or continuation is underway. This dual-indicator approach is supported by trading wisdom – for instance, an oversold RSI gains much more credibility if a MACD bullish crossover follows it, and an overbought RSI is far more ominous if accompanied by a MACD bearish crossover
investopedia.com
. Our automation tool will scan the daily charts of the stock for these conditions and label each ticker’s status as “Early Buy Signal,” “Confirmed Buy Signal,” “Early Sell (Overbought)”, “Confirmed Sell,” or “Neutral,” etc. The exact logic might look like:

Early Buy: RSI < 30 (oversold) or a bullish divergence, and price at or above a key support.

Confirmed Buy: A bullish MACD crossover or break above a trendline/MA after an earlier oversold condition.

Early Sell: RSI > 70 (overbought) or bearish divergence forming.

Confirmed Sell: MACD bearish crossover or break below support/MA following an overbought condition.

This gives a structured way to track “early entry vs confirmation entry vs sell” as the user requested, with clear technical criteria behind each label.

Fundamental Analysis & Intrinsic Value Metrics (DCF, Financials, RPO, etc.)

In addition to technical signals, our tool will incorporate fundamental analysis to ensure we buy quality companies at reasonable prices (for long-term success). This involves examining the company’s financial health, growth prospects, and valuation. Key fundamental methodologies and metrics to include:

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation: DCF is a method to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them to present value. Incorporating a DCF model can tell us if a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its current price. For example, using a reasonable growth and discount rate, one might estimate Apple’s fair value and compare it to the market price. If our DCF model says Apple is worth $200 per share but it’s trading at $230, Apple appears overvalued (no margin of safety). In fact, one recent DCF analysis estimated Apple’s intrinsic value around $193.38 per share, which was about 18% lower than the market price (~$237 at the time), indicating Apple was overvalued
acquirersmultiple.com
. Our system can incorporate such valuation estimates: a stock trading significantly below its DCF fair value would score positively (a potential long-term buy), whereas one trading far above its DCF value might warrant caution or a sell flag despite technical signals. DCF can be computed periodically (e.g. when new earnings come out) or we can input an analyst consensus fair value. The main idea is to avoid chasing technically-attractive stocks that are wildly overpriced, and to give extra confidence to buying fundamentally undervalued stocks when technical buy signals appear. Remember, fundamental analysis yields a fair price which investors use to judge if a stock is undervalued (buy) or overvalued (sell) in the long run
investopedia.com
.

Financial Statement Metrics: We will parse the company’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for critical metrics:

Revenue and Earnings Growth – Is the company’s revenue growing year-over-year? Are earnings (net income) growing? Consistent growth is a positive sign. For Apple, revenue has grown modestly in recent years (e.g. FY2024 revenue $391B was up ~2% from $383B in FY2023
monexa.ai
) and analysts expect re-acceleration (FY2025 revenue forecast +4%, EPS +10%
monexa.ai
). The tool can track quarterly/yearly growth rates and flag if growth is turning negative (which could justify a sell or at least caution on long-term holdings).

Profit Margins – High and stable (or improving) margins indicate a strong business. We can track gross margin, operating margin, and net margin. In Apple’s case, despite recent flat revenue, gross margin reached 46.2% in FY2024 (an improvement from ~44% in prior years) and operating margin ~31.5%
monexa.ai
 – very robust. Declining margins might signal competitive pressure or cost issues. Our system could flag if, say, gross margin drops significantly or if net margin is trending down, as that might foreshadow weaker earnings quality.

Per-Share Metrics – We should evaluate metrics on a per-share basis to account for dilution or buybacks. Earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow per share are crucial. If EPS and cash flow per share are rising consistently, it’s a sign of shareholder value creation (even better if shares outstanding are decreasing via buybacks). Apple, for instance, engages in massive buybacks (reducing share count), which helped its EPS grow even in years when net income was flat. Our tool can monitor share count changes, EPS growth, and even stock-based compensation (SBC) levels. High SBC (common in tech firms) can dilute shareholders, so if a company’s SBC expense is, say, a large percentage of revenue or is causing share count to rise, we’d note that as a fundamental weakness. In Apple’s case, stock-based comp is relatively modest and offset by buybacks (Apple spent ~$95B on repurchases in FY2024
monexa.ai
, shrinking its float), so per-share metrics improved. We will prefer companies that are mindful of shareholder dilution.

Financial Health – This includes debt levels, liquidity, and efficiency. Key metrics: Debt-to-Equity ratio, Current ratio, and Interest coverage. A strong balance sheet (low debt, high cash) gives a company resilience. Our system can check, for example, if net debt is reasonable relative to earnings. Apple’s balance sheet strategy is unique – it has a lot of cash but also significant debt due to financing buybacks. Apple’s *debt-to-equity looks high (over 100% leverage) because it has negative net cash and a small equity base after buybacks)
monexa.ai
, but its net debt/EBITDA is low (~0.5x) due to huge cash flows
monexa.ai
. The tool might create a composite “financial health score” considering liquidity (current ratio), solvency (debt ratios), and profitability (ROE, ROA). For example, a current ratio below 1 could be a warning unless the company’s cash flow is consistently strong (as is the case with Apple’s 0.82 current ratio, which is acceptable given its cash generation
monexa.ai
). We will flag extreme leverage or cash shortages as risk factors.

Profitability & Efficiency – Metrics like Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) indicate management’s effectiveness. Apple excels here: it had a trailing ROIC of ~47% and ROE over 150% (inflated by buybacks reducing equity)
monexa.ai
 – a sign of an exceptional business. High ROE/ROIC, especially if consistent, is a positive long-term indicator. The dashboard can display these metrics, and we might favor companies with ROE >, say, 15% for quality. Operating efficiency ratios (asset turnover, etc.) could also be considered if needed.

Valuation Multiples: Alongside DCF, simpler valuation metrics should be tracked:

Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price/Sales (P/S), PEG ratio (P/E to growth), EV/EBITDA, etc. These tell us how the market is valuing the company’s profits and revenues. For instance, Apple currently trades at a TTM P/E around 28-30 and P/S around 7.5-11 (depending on TTM vs forward)
monexa.ai
ainvest.com
 – which is high historically, implying investors expect solid growth. Our tool can compare a stock’s multiples to its historical range or sector peers. If a company’s P/E is, say, 50 while its earnings are growing 5% annually, that’s a red flag (overvaluation). In Apple’s case, a P/S above 11 and P/B ~3.2 are elevated relative to its past
ainvest.com
ainvest.com
, which suggests the stock isn’t cheap. We’d incorporate that knowledge: a high valuation might mean any technical buy signal should be treated more cautiously or only for a short-term trade, whereas a low valuation (e.g. P/E near multi-year lows) could encourage us to trust buy signals more and maybe hold longer.

Margins of Safety: We can also define a margin-of-safety threshold on valuation. For example, only label a stock as a “value buy” if its market price is at least 20% below the DCF fair value or if it trades at a P/E below a certain cutoff relative to its growth. This ensures we’re selecting investments that have a statistical edge. To illustrate, since Apple’s price was recently ~4.9% below one fair-value estimate (fair value ~$218 vs price ~$205 at one point)
finance.yahoo.com
, that was only a slight margin – not a huge bargain. Indeed, another source showed Apple at an 18% premium above intrinsic value
acquirersmultiple.com
. So Apple might not qualify as “undervalued” by our fundamental criteria at the moment, even though it’s a high-quality company.

Company-Specific KPIs: We should allow adding custom metrics depending on the company/sector. The user mentioned Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) – this is relevant for subscription-based or software companies. RPO represents the total value of contracted products/services that are not yet delivered (the backlog of revenue)
thesaascfo.com
. Tracking RPO (and the portion due in the Next 12 Months, NTM) is useful for companies like Salesforce or other SaaS vendors because it indicates future revenue growth locked in. Our tool could parse SEC filings for RPO figures and see if they are growing (a good sign) or shrinking (a potential issue). For Apple, RPO isn’t a major disclosed metric (Apple has deferred revenue from services like AppleCare, but it’s not as crucial as for pure SaaS firms). Instead, Apple’s key operational KPIs might be iPhone sales, Services segment growth, etc. As an example, if we were analyzing a cloud software stock, we’d want to ingest its RPO from the 10-Q reports and perhaps trigger a note like “RPO up 30% year-over-year – strong future revenue visibility” which bolsters the fundamental case. Similarly, other KPIs could be used: e.g. bookings, subscriber count, user growth, same-store sales (for retail), orders backlog (for manufacturing), etc., depending on the company. The system can be designed to fetch these from filings or company reports if available (possibly via textual search or using an API that provides such data).

Management & Qualitative Factors: Some aspects are harder to quantify but worth noting. A company’s management quality could be reflected in consistent execution (hitting guidance, prudently managing debt/equity, avoiding excessive dilution). While our automated system can’t directly “score” management’s character, it can indirectly measure management effectiveness via the metrics above (ROIC, profit consistency, etc.). We should also pay attention to things like shareholder friendliness (e.g. does the company return cash via dividends/buybacks or is it constantly issuing new shares?). In Apple’s case, management has been very shareholder-friendly (huge buybacks and steady dividends)
monexa.ai
. Our tool might simply note dividend yield and payout ratio as well. For Apple, the dividend yield is only ~0.5%, but the payout ratio ~16% leaves room for future increases
monexa.ai
 – a sign of strong cash generation. We will incorporate such info into the dashboard for completeness, so that you can see at a glance a company’s dividend yield, buyback amount, etc., which inform the long-term investment decision (e.g. a high yield or buyback yield could be a positive factor to hold a stock).

By integrating these fundamental metrics, the system will provide a comprehensive view of each stock’s quality and valuation. Fundamentally, we want the tool to answer: Is this a company I want to own for the long run (quality business, healthy finances)? And if so, is the current price attractive or not? These fundamental insights will guide how we use the technical signals. For example, if a stock is fundamentally strong and undervalued, we can be more aggressive on buy signals and perhaps treat them as “early entries” into a long-term position. If a stock is fundamentally weak or very overvalued, even a technical “buy” signal might be treated with skepticism or for a quick trade only. In short, combining fundamentals with technicals gives the best of both worlds: fundamentals tell us what to buy (or avoid) and technicals tell us when to buy or sell. Indeed, investors often use a blend of both methods for the most robust strategy
investopedia.com
.

Combining Signals: Early vs. Confirmed Entries (Integrating Tech + Fundamental)

Now, the core of the strategy is to integrate the above technical and fundamental factors to generate actionable signals. As the “greatest stock trader and quant” persona, we want to design a system that uses all available information to maximize the probability of successful trades. Here’s how we can combine the pieces into a coherent decision engine:

Fundamental Filter & Scoring: The first step is to evaluate the stock’s fundamentals and assign a score or classification. This could be as simple as “Pass/Fail” or a numeric score. For instance, we might require certain minimum criteria for a stock to be considered for an “early entry” buy: e.g. revenue growth positive, net profit positive, manageable debt, and not extremely overvalued by DCF. If a stock fails the fundamental quality threshold, the system might ignore buy signals (or at least flag that any buy is speculative). Stocks that pass get labeled as “fundamentally solid” or even “fundamentally undervalued” if their price is below intrinsic value. In our Apple example, Apple would easily pass quality checks (huge cash flow, high margins, etc.), but it might get a note that valuation is on the high side (no big margin of safety). We’d still consider Apple for trading, but we’d size positions accordingly. On the other hand, if this were a small company with losses and heavy debt, the tool might either exclude it or only allow short-term technical trades with caution. This fundamental step ensures we are selective about where to deploy capital.

Detection of Early Technical Signals: The next component scans for those early signals on the technical side – mainly extreme indicator readings or pattern setups. For each trading day (or week), the system will compute RSI and MACD from the price data (plus possibly moving averages, trendlines, etc.). If conditions like “RSI < 30” or “RSI just rose above 30 from below” occur, the tool flags an Early Entry signal. Similarly, a bullish divergence (price made a lower low but RSI made a higher low) could count as an early reversal sign. These early signals are essentially the “heads up” alerts – they suggest a potential change in trend is brewing. The system should log them but not necessarily act in full force yet. For example, suppose Apple’s stock plunges over two weeks and RSI hits 25 (deep oversold) while the price reaches a long-term support level. Our tool would flag “Apple early buy signal – oversold at support.” If Apple’s fundamentals are solid, this could be a great opportunity to start accumulating a position before the rest of the market realizes the value. However, because it’s “early,” one might start with a small position or at least keep monitoring for confirmation.

Confirmation Signals & Trade Execution: The tool then looks for confirmation signals to validate the early alert. Continuing the example, after Apple’s RSI hit 25, imagine a week later the stock stopped falling and MACD gave a bullish crossover. At that point, the system would upgrade the signal to “Confirmed Buy” – meaning the probability of a reversal is now much higher. It might also confirm via price action: e.g. Apple’s price may have closed back above the 20-day moving average, or a candlestick pattern (like a strong reversal day) formed. Once confirmed, the tool can be configured to either send a strong alert (e.g. email/SMS “Buy Signal CONFIRMED for AAPL”) or even trigger an automated buy order if we were doing full automation. The confirmation step is crucial to avoid false starts. It essentially answers: Did the market indeed turn in the expected direction? By waiting for confirmation, we trade a bit of lag for a higher success rate.

Position Sizing & Combining Signals: A sophisticated angle is to let the strength of fundamental and technical signals influence how much to trade. For example, if a stock is fundamentally A+ quality and deeply undervalued, and we get an early technical buy, we might choose to take a partial position on the early signal (because the risk of long-term wrongness is low – even if it dips more, the fundamentals justify owning it). Then on confirmation, we’d add more. In contrast, if a stock is just average fundamentals or fairly valued, we might wait for full confirmation before buying at all, or trade a smaller size. The tool can incorporate these rules-based position sizing. One could imagine a formula or a simple matrix: Fundamental Score vs. Technical Signal to decide action. For instance:

High fundamental score + early technical signal = enter half position now, half on confirmation.

High fundamental + confirmed technical = enter full position.

Low fundamental score + early technical = no trade (or very small speculative trade).

Low fundamental + confirmed technical = maybe a quick short-term trade if at all, with tight stop.

This way, the highest-probability scenario (great company, great setup) gets the most capital, aligning with making money in the highest probability situations (point 4 of your query). This approach is how a quant might design a system to maximize expected return while managing risk.

Sell and Profit-Taking Logic: Just as we look for entries, the system should monitor for exit signals. These can be symmetric. If we entered on an RSI oversold and MACD cross, we might plan to exit when RSI goes, say, above 70 and then falls back or when MACD crosses down. The tool will continuously track the positions and underlying signals. For a long-term position, “sell signals” might be used more to trim or issue warnings rather than immediately liquidating a quality stock. For example, if Apple rallies and becomes very overbought on technicals and suppose its valuation shoots up (P/E gets extreme), the system might flag “Consider taking profits on Apple – price well above intrinsic value and stock overbought.” The user can then decide to sell all or some. In a swing trading context, the sell signal likely means closing the trade. We will implement trailing stops or target prices as well if desired: e.g. once a confirmed buy is triggered, the system could set a notional target (maybe based on prior highs or a Fibonacci retracement) and a stop (below the recent swing low). If either is hit, it alerts an exit. All these risk management measures ensure the tool isn't just buying well but also selling at the right time to lock in gains or cut losses.

Alerts and Dashboard Updates: Finally, when any of these conditions are met (early buy, confirmed buy, sell, etc.), the system will output this information clearly. On a dashboard, Apple’s ticker might be color-coded or tagged (e.g. “AAPL – Confirmed Buy 😃” or “AAPL – Overbought, watch out ⚠️”). For email/SMS alerts, it might send a message like “AAPL confirmed buy signal: MACD bullish crossover on 8/14/2025 after oversold conditions
investopedia.com
. Fundamentals strong; consider entry.” Each alert can include brief reasoning (perhaps citing which indicators triggered). This keeps the user in the loop without needing to constantly watch everything manually.

To illustrate the early vs. confirmed interplay with Apple: Imagine Apple’s stock price had dropped to $170 and RSI hit 28 (oversold) while our fundamental check shows Apple is still a cash-generating powerhouse (and maybe our DCF says intrinsic value $200). The tool flags “Early Buy – Apple oversold”. A few days later, Apple’s price starts rising, the 14-day RSI crosses above 30, and MACD flashes a bullish crossover — now the tool flags “Confirmed Buy – Apple momentum turning up
investopedia.com
.” At that point, one could confidently buy or add to a position. Fast forward, suppose Apple recovers to $200+ and RSI goes above 70; the tool might then send an “Early Sell (Take Profit)” alert due to overbought RSI. If subsequently the MACD crosses down or some weakness appears, it would give a “Confirmed Sell – momentum turning down after overbought” signal. This systematic approach ensures we buy low (when others are fearful and the stock is oversold but fundamentally fine) and sell high (when others are greedy and the stock is overbought/expensive) – the essence of profitable trading.

Notably, combining fundamental and technical factors in this way is often called a quantamental strategy. It is widely considered effective because it leverages complementary strengths: fundamental analysis finds good companies/true value, and technical analysis times the market’s behavior
investopedia.com
. By designing the automation tool around these principles, we greatly increase the probability of success compared to relying on only one approach. As Investopedia succinctly puts it, “a combination of fundamental, technical, and quantitative analysis is the most beneficial” for investors
investopedia.com
 – that’s exactly what we’re building.

Implementation Plan (Data Sources, Python Automation, and Alerts)

Now that we have the methodology, let’s discuss how to implement this in Python and deliver the results through your web front-end (and/or email alerts). We want a cost-effective solution for data, so we’ll utilize free or cheap resources where possible, and schedule a batch script to run the analysis.

Data Acquisition: We’ll need two main categories of data – historical price data (for technical indicators) and financial fundamental data (for the metrics discussed).

Price Data (for RSI, MACD, etc.): Fortunately, historical daily price data (OHLCV – open, high, low, close, volume) for stocks like Apple can be obtained for free. One convenient source is Yahoo Finance, which provides daily and even intraday data. There are Python libraries like yfinance or pandas_datareader that can fetch Yahoo Finance data easily. For example, using yfinance, you can download Apple’s last 5 years of daily prices in a few lines of code. Another free source is Alpha Vantage (they have a free API key tier, though with request limits), or IEX Cloud (which offers some free data). Since Yahoo’s data is comprehensive and free, we can stick with that via yfinance – it will give us daily closes which we can use to compute RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc. If more resolution is needed (say hourly data for finer timing), we could pull that too, but given we’re avoiding day-trading, daily should suffice. We will also retrieve weekly prices (or simply resample daily to weekly) to compute weekly RSI/MACD for our trend alignment step. Price data is relatively “cheap” information; even if one needed paid data, it’s widely available, but free sources should do for this project. Storage: We can either fetch fresh data each day or store time series in a local database (SQLite, CSV files, etc.) that the script updates. Since you plan to run in batch, a typical setup is: each evening, run the Python script, it fetches the latest prices (e.g. last close for each stock of interest), updates the technical indicators, and determines if any signals triggered today.

Fundamental Data: This is a bit more involved, but we have a plan. For many high-level metrics (P/E, revenue, etc.), Yahoo Finance also provides data (for example, Yahoo Finance shows Apple’s key stats like TTM revenue, cash flow, P/E, etc. on its summary or statistics page
finance.yahoo.com
). Libraries like yfinance can retrieve some fundamental fields (like P/E, PEG, etc.). However, for deeper analysis (e.g. pulling the last 4 quarters of income statement to calculate growth, or getting RPO from footnotes), we might need to parse SEC filings or use an API:

The U.S. SEC EDGAR system publishes all quarterly and annual filings (10-Q, 10-K) which contain detailed financial statements and notes. These can be downloaded for free (EDGAR has APIs and also the filings are available in HTML or XBRL format). We could use Python packages like sec-edgar-downloader or directly use requests/BeautifulSoup to pull specific data. For example, to get Apple’s Remaining Performance Obligations, one would download Apple’s 10-K and search for “remaining performance obligation” in the text – since RPO is often discussed in revenue recognition footnotes. This parsing is doable and gives extremely rich info (like exact values of deferred revenue, etc.), but it requires some effort to code robustly. Given that you mentioned possibly parsing SEC filings, it’s a great idea for capturing things like RPO, management commentary, segment data, etc. We should prioritize what fundamental data we truly need to automate:

For our purposes, key financial line items like revenue, net income, EPS, free cash flow, debt, etc., can actually be pulled from aggregated sources (Yahoo Finance, Financial Modeling Prep API, or even Python’s yfinance which has a get_financials() method). For instance, Yahoo Finance’s API (unofficially via yfinance) can provide the last few years of financial statements in a structured way. This might be easier than parsing raw SEC filings for those basics.

For special metrics like RPO or backlog not in the standard financial statements, direct SEC parsing is needed. We could implement a targeted parser that looks for “Remaining Performance Obligation” in 10-K/10-Q filings and extracts the number (usually they report total RPO and the portion due within 12 months). The good news: RPO is usually only meaningful for certain types of companies (SaaS, etc.), so we might make this module on-demand (for Apple, it won’t be a factor; for Salesforce, it would).

Valuation and ratios: Some can be computed (P/E = price / EPS, etc.). Others we might get from a service. For example, we can compute DCF internally by making assumptions or we might leverage crowd-sourced estimates (like from ValueInvesting.io or other sites, but to keep it cheap, it’s better we calculate ourselves). We can use analysts’ consensus growth for projections (which can be scraped from Yahoo Analyst Estimates or from a site like SeekingAlpha or Finviz). Alternatively, keep it simple: use a constant growth DCF with conservative inputs. This part might not be extremely precise, but even a rough DCF giving a ballpark fair price is useful. We’ll incorporate a margin of safety anyway.

There are also free financial data APIs: for example, Financial Modeling Prep has a free tier that provides JSON data for financial statements and a bunch of ratios; Alpha Vantage has endpoints for earnings and financials. These could simplify getting fundamentals without parsing HTML. If cost is truly an issue, the free tiers should suffice for a handful of tickers like Apple (they usually limit the number of API calls per minute/day).

In summary, Yahoo Finance + occasional SEC parsing should cover most needs at little to no cost. The user (you) can also manually supply certain data if needed (since you offered to “bring the data” for whichever is cheap and has many info). For example, if you already have a subscription to some service or have downloaded financial statements, you can feed that into the system. Our tool will be flexible to accept input data from various sources as long as we have the necessary fields to compute our metrics.

Python Framework: We will create a Python script (or set of scripts) to perform the following on a daily schedule:

Data Update: Fetch the latest prices (daily close, etc.) for the stock(s) we’re tracking. Fetch or update fundamental data if new reports have come (perhaps check quarterly).

Compute Indicators: Using the price data, calculate RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc. We can use libraries like pandas_ta or write our own small functions (RSI is straightforward to compute as 14-day average gains vs losses
investopedia.com
, and MACD as EMA differences). There are also technical analysis libraries that can compute dozens of indicators easily. We will also maintain some state (e.g. yesterday’s MACD to know if a crossover happened today).

Analyze Conditions: Apply the rules we discussed. For each stock (like AAPL), determine:

Is RSI oversold or overbought? (Crossing threshold events)

Did MACD just cross up or down? Is it above or below zero?

Is price above/below key MAs or support levels? (We might pre-define support/resistance or use previous pivot points).

Evaluate these in context: was there an “early” signal recently that is now being confirmed?

Check fundamental status: e.g. AAPL’s latest P/E, is it > X? Price vs DCF value, etc.

Based on all that, assign or update a “signal status” for the stock.

Output Results: Update the front-end and send alerts as needed. The front-end (per the GitHub link you provided, choym92/araverus) likely expects data in a certain format or maybe reads from a database. We can have the Python script save results (like signals, indicator values, etc.) into a JSON or database that the web app uses. For instance, the script could generate an signals.json with content like {"AAPL": {"Signal":"Confirmed Buy", "RSI":28, "MACD":"Bullish Cross", "Comment":"Oversold, turnaround confirmed"}, ...}. The web dashboard can read this and display nicely. Alternatively, the script can directly update an HTML dashboard if the front-end is static. Since you have a web front-end, a dynamic approach might be to use Flask or Django to serve pages, but given you have an existing project, we’ll integrate into that.

For email alerts, Python can send emails via SMTP (using a Gmail account or any SMTP server). We’d configure it to send an email when a new confirmed signal appears. For example, “Subject: Stock Alert – AAPL Confirmed Sell” with body text detailing the signal. We can throttle these to only truly significant changes to avoid spamming. You may prefer a daily summary email instead, listing all the signals of the day. The design is flexible: you could do immediate alerts for confirmed buys/sells and a morning summary of everything.

If real-time notification is needed, one could integrate with services like Twilio (for SMS) or Telegram bots or push notifications. But since we’re not doing intraday, email is usually sufficient (or even a desktop notification if you have a companion app).

The dashboard itself can be the primary way to visualize all the data. Ideally, it will show for Apple: the current price vs our calculated intrinsic value, latest financial metrics, and the technical indicator status (maybe even small charts or spark lines for RSI/MACD). It might have a table with columns like “Ticker | Fundamental Score | Technical Signal | Action”. For instance: AAPL | Quality: High, Valuation: Fair | RSI 72 (Overbought), MACD fading | Signal: Consider Sell/Wait (overbought). This gives a quick glance for the user.

We should also incorporate historical perspective in the dashboard where useful. For example, show a small chart of Apple’s price with markers where our system would have signaled buys and sells, to validate the methodology. That could be a later enhancement, using Plotly or matplotlib to plot price and indicator thresholds, and embedding that in the web UI.

Front-End Integration: The GitHub link suggests you have a React (perhaps) front-end named Araverus. Possibly it’s designed to display research/analysis. To integrate, one approach is:

The Python batch can dump data into a format that the frontend reads. This could be as simple as JSON files stored in a folder that the web app fetches periodically via AJAX. Or if the front-end is also served by Python, we could generate HTML components directly.

Given your front-end is separate, I’d lean on having the Python script push the results to a backend that the frontend can query. If Araverus doesn’t have a backend, we can create a lightweight Flask API that serves the signals. However, if this is too much, writing results to a database that the front-end can access is another way (for instance, an SQLite db or Google Sheets). But since you likely control both ends, I suspect a direct integration is fine.

The front-end can be a dashboard with multiple sections: one for technical analysis (charts or indicator readings), one for fundamentals (financial ratios, maybe a mini financial statement), and one for the resulting recommendation (Buy/Sell/Hold). Think of it as a combined stock report card.

Dashboard vs. Email Alerts: You asked which is better. My recommendation is to use both in complementary ways:

Dashboard: Great for deep dives and monitoring many metrics in one place. It’s passive – you have to check it – but it can show rich information (graphs, tables, trends over time). This is perfect for reviewing the state of your portfolio or watchlist each day. For instance, on the dashboard you could click Apple and see its 1-year chart with RSI and MACD plotted, alongside fundamental trend charts (revenue, EPS over years), and our system’s latest signal status.

Email Alerts: Great for being notified of critical events without actively watching the dashboard. For example, if a stock on your watchlist hits a confirmed buy signal after a long wait, you’d want an email so you can act that day. Similarly, if a stock you own triggers a sell signal or something fundamentally changes (e.g. an earnings drop), an alert ensures you don’t miss it. Since you mentioned not having time for day trading, email (or push) alerts allow a more hands-off approach – the system will poke you when there’s something actionable.

There’s no strict either/or: I suggest implementing the dashboard for comprehensive analysis and supplementing it with an email alert system for key signals. This way, you have the best of both: automated notification and a platform to analyze details. The email can even contain a snapshot of info and then direct you to the dashboard for more (e.g. “Apple Confirmed Buy – see dashboard for charts and details.”).

From a technical standpoint, setting up email alerts in Python is straightforward (using smtplib or a service like SendGrid). The dashboard we’ve already covered integration ideas.

Finally, let’s tie this together with Apple as our example case to ensure everything is concrete:

Case Study: Apple (AAPL) – Signal Tracker Example

Using Apple Inc. as a test case, we can demonstrate how the automated tool would work:

Fundamental Snapshot: Apple is a high-quality business with huge cash flows and profitability. It scores well on fundamentals: for FY2024 it had ~$94B in net income with a net profit margin ~24%
monexa.ai
, ROIC 47%, and steady revenue (slight growth expected to resume)
monexa.ai
. However, Apple’s valuation is relatively expensive now. Its forward P/E is in the high 20s and its P/S around 7-8; Apple’s P/B of ~3.2 and P/S of ~11 (ttm) are elevated, reflecting high market expectations
ainvest.com
ainvest.com
. Our DCF analysis (or the cited one) suggests a fair value around $190–$200, which means at the current price ($230 as of Aug 2025) Apple might be ~15-20% overvalued
acquirersmultiple.com
. The tool would note this: maybe give Apple a “Fundamental: **High Quality, but Valuation: Above Fair Value” label. That implies we love the company but would prefer to buy on dips rather than at peak prices.

Recent Technical Picture: Apple’s stock had a strong run in 2023-2025, but recently the momentum has stalled. After a 12% rise in the past month or two
ainvest.com
, technical indicators turned overbought. The RSI reached the high-60s to 70+ range (signaling overbought conditions), and indeed an analysis on Aug 14, 2025 noted “overbought technical indicators” and mixed signals, suggesting a possible correction ahead
ainvest.com
. Our system likely would have flagged an “Early Sell” on Apple when RSI exceeded 70 in early August. It might also have caught a Williams %R overbought or other indicator (as that analysis mentioned WR overbought
ainvest.com
). At the same time, MACD for Apple might have shown a “golden cross” (bullish) but weakening momentum
ainvest.com
 – a conflicting signal. In such cases, the system would mark Apple as in a neutral or caution zone: basically, “price is high, momentum is strong but possibly peaking.” The action recommended (as in the AInvest piece) was to wait for a pullback or clear confirmation before new buying
ainvest.com
. Our tool would mirror that: no new buy signal at these overbought levels; possibly a hold or partial sell if you’re short-term trading.

How the Tool Helps: Suppose Apple starts pulling back from $230 to, say, $210. During this pullback, its RSI might drop from overbought towards neutral. If it keeps falling and goes under 30 (hypothetically), that would trigger our early buy alert – but importantly, we’d check: is it near a support (perhaps $197 was a noted support area
investopedia.com
investopedia.com
)? If yes and fundamentals still great, early buyers might step in. The tool would signal “Apple oversold now – potential early entry”. You’d get that alert and know to watch Apple closely. If subsequently Apple’s price stabilizes and we get a positive MACD crossover and maybe a bounce off that support, the tool would flash a Confirmed Buy for Apple. This could be the ideal swing entry, and a long-term add since Apple’s a company you want to hold. The system would thus have guided you to sell or hold off when Apple was expensive and euphoric, and to buy when it became cheap and hated – exactly what we want.

Incorporating Earnings/News: Another advantage – Apple’s signals can be supplemented with fundamental news. For example, Apple reports earnings every quarter that our fundamental module will catch. If Apple surprises negatively (say iPhone sales drop), our fundamental score might weaken (or at least the tool would output “Earnings down -10% this quarter” which could justify a more bearish stance). Conversely, if Apple announces a new product or a blowout quarter, the fundamental outlook improves. The technical system can’t foresee that, but by parsing news or earnings data, the tool can adjust. It could be as simple as a rule: if a big earnings miss, treat any technical buy with caution (could be a value trap); if a big beat and stock pops, maybe don’t sell on an overbought RSI immediately because fundamentals just stepped up (the overbought might be justified by new value). These nuances can be built in over time as you refine the system.

Dashboard View for Apple: On the dashboard, Apple’s card might display:

Status: “Hold/Wait – Overbought recently” (as of now).

Last Signal: “Early Sell on Aug 8 (RSI ~75). No confirmed buy yet; waiting for pullback.”

Fundamentals: “Quality A, Valuation C. Revenue +4% YoY, EPS +10% YoY expected. DCF ≈ $200 vs Price $230 (Overvalued)
acquirersmultiple.com
. ROE 150%, Debt/Equity high but cash flow strong.”

Indicators: “RSI 68, MACD flattening, 50-day MA = $220 (price is above).” Perhaps even a small sparkline of RSI showing it coming down from overbought.

Recommendation: “📊 Watch for RSI < 40 and price around $200 for a better entry. Long-term investors can hold; not an optimal fresh buy point until technicals reset.”

This kind of integrated output is extremely useful for making decisions. It distills a mountain of data into a concise overview with action items.

In conclusion, the automation tool will effectively serve as your 24/7 analyst, tracking each stock’s vital signs both technically and fundamentally, and alerting you to the most promising opportunities (and dangers). By combining long-term fundamental wisdom (what to buy, approximate value, company health) with short-term and medium-term technical timing (when to buy or sell), the system aims to capture the highest-probability money-making opportunities – whether they come daily, weekly, or monthly. Some signals might be rare (e.g. a deeply undervalued, oversold situation) but very lucrative when they occur, while others might be more frequent minor swing trades. The key is, you won’t have to stare at charts all day; the Python backend will do that for you and ping you when it’s time to act, and the dashboard will be there for you to review and confirm the analysis.

By perfecting this setup with continuous refinements (e.g. adjusting thresholds, adding new metrics like RPO for relevant stocks, parsing SEC filings for any new red flags, etc.), you’ll have a powerful automated assistant for trading and investing. It will embody the thought process of a seasoned quant and trader, but operate tirelessly in the background. Ultimately, the goal is to buy fundamentally strong stocks when technicals indicate an early upturn, confirm the trend, and sell when either the fundamentals deteriorate or the technicals signal excessive euphoria – thereby maximizing gains and minimizing risk. This methodology, applied to Apple here, can be expanded to your other stock tickers once proven out. Happy building, and best of luck with Araverus – it sounds like an exciting project to visualize and automate these insights!
