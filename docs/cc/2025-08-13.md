## Summary (16:00)
- **What**: Created 6 Claude Code automation commands for workflow optimization
- **Why**: Maximize Claude Code effectiveness with PRP systems and agent-based development
- **Impact**: Developer workflow automation - /eod, /gen-pr, /review-diff, /agent-* commands available
- **Verify**: Lint/build passed ✓, commands created ✓, MCP servers connected ✓
- **Next**: Complete Hooks automation setup for automatic code verification

## Context Engineering & PRP System Setup
Following YouTube video guidance to implement comprehensive Claude Code optimization:
- Updated CLAUDE.md with global rules and context engineering principles
- Implemented role-based authorization system (authz.ts) 
- Configured Context7 MCP server for real-time documentation access
- Built PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) workflow with generate-prp and execute-prp commands

## Command Creation Session
Created 6 automated workflow commands in .claude/commands/:
1. **agent-reviewer.md** - Staff+ level code reviews with security focus
2. **agent-architect.md** - System architecture and data flow planning  
3. **agent-docs.md** - Concise documentation with verification checklists
4. **review-diff.md** - Staged changes review with safe fix proposals
5. **gen-pr.md** - Conventional commit PR generation from branch diff
6. **eod.md** - End-of-day logging with 5-line summaries

## Technical Implementation
- **Auth Migration**: Replaced email hardcoding with role-based admin checks
- **MCP Integration**: Successfully connected Context7 for library documentation
- **Validation**: All changes pass lint/build checks
- **File Structure**: Proper command organization under .claude/commands/

## Next Session Priorities
- Complete Hooks automation for automatic verification on code changes
- Test newly created agent commands with real code changes
- Optimize Memory System for persistent project context
- Agent workflow refinement based on usage patterns
