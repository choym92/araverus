## Summary (13:23)
- **What**: wire execute-prp to auto review/PR/EoD; add staged diff reviewer; tighten hooks
- **Why**: end-to-end automation (plan→execute→review→PR→EoD)
- **Impact**: config/docs only; no DB schema change
- **Verify**: lint/build OK; staged-diff agent linked to BeforeCommit
- **Next**: optional /auto-prp command for one-shot INITIAL→generate-prp

## Summary (16:00)
- **What**: Created 6 Claude Code automation commands for workflow optimization
- **Why**: Maximize Claude Code effectiveness with PRP systems and agent-based development
- **Impact**: Developer workflow automation - /eod, /gen-pr, /review-diff, /agent-* commands available
- **Verify**: Lint/build passed ✓, commands created ✓, MCP servers connected ✓
- **Next**: Complete Hooks automation setup for automatic code verification

## Summary (21:30)
- **What**: Complete MDX blog migration with automation commands
- **Why**: Zero runtime DB dependency, Git-based authoring, improved performance
- **Impact**: TipTap→MDX migration complete, /new-post & /ensure-rss commands, RSS feed
- **Verify**: Build passed ✓, category filtering maintained ✓, draft system working ✓
- **Next**: Production deployment with NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL configuration

# Daily Log - 2025-08-13

## Context Engineering & PRP System Setup
Following YouTube video guidance to implement comprehensive Claude Code optimization:
- Updated CLAUDE.md with global rules and context engineering principles
- Implemented role-based authorization system (authz.ts) 
- Configured Context7 MCP server for real-time documentation access
- Built PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) workflow with generate-prp and execute-prp commands

## Command Creation Session
Created 6 automated workflow commands in .claude/commands/:
1. **agent-reviewer.md** - Staff+ level code reviews with security focus
2. **agent-architect.md** - System architecture and data flow planning  
3. **agent-docs.md** - Concise documentation with verification checklists
4. **review-diff.md** - Staged changes review with safe fix proposals
5. **gen-pr.md** - Conventional commit PR generation from branch diff
6. **eod.md** - End-of-day logging with 5-line summaries

## Technical Implementation
- **Auth Migration**: Replaced email hardcoding with role-based admin checks
- **MCP Integration**: Successfully connected Context7 for library documentation
- **Validation**: All changes pass lint/build checks
- **File Structure**: Proper command organization under .claude/commands/

## MDX Blog Migration Complete
Major system overhaul executed via PRP workflow:
- **Migration Strategy**: TipTap database-driven → MDX static file-based blog system
- **Architecture Change**: Zero runtime database dependency, full static generation
- **Content Management**: Git + Obsidian authoring workflow with frontmatter metadata
- **Category System**: Publication/Tutorial/Insight/Release filtering maintained
- **Performance**: Static generation with generateStaticParams for optimal loading
- **RSS Integration**: Auto-generated XML feed with caching and proper escaping

## Blog Automation Commands Added
- **new-post.md**: Creates MDX scaffold with proper folder structure and Korean templates
- **ensure-rss.md**: Generates/verifies RSS endpoint with feed discoverability
- **Comprehensive Docs**: Complete authoring guide in docs/blog-writing-guide.md

## Technical Accomplishments
- Removed 2606 lines (TipTap dependencies, API routes, admin editor)
- Added 2768 lines (MDX system, automation, documentation)
- Draft system: visible in dev, 404 in production
- Image workflow: public/blog/[slug]/ → /blog/[slug]/image.jpg
- RSS feed at /rss.xml with proper caching headers

## Next Session Priorities
- Production deployment with NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL environment variable
- Test blog authoring workflow in production environment
- Optimize Memory System for persistent project context
- Agent workflow refinement based on usage patterns
