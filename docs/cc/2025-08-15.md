## Finance Tab M0 Architecture Setup

### What: Setting up Python quant sidecar for stock data processing
- Created new branch: `feature/finance-tab-m0-setup`
- Established folder structure: `quant/` directory with modular components
- Created `engine.py` as main orchestration script

### Why: Separate concerns between Next.js frontend and data processing
- Keep Next.js deployable on Vercel (no Python dependencies)
- Heavy data processing happens in Python sidecar
- Clean data contract between frontend and backend

### How: Basic implementation with room for iteration
- `quant/engine.py` - Main orchestrator that runs daily batch
- `data_sources/` - For fetching stock data from various APIs
- `features/` - Signal generation and technical analysis
- `io/` - Database connections and data persistence

## Future Improvements Needed for Production

### 1. Retry Logic & Error Handling
- No retry mechanism if API calls fail
- Should handle rate limits gracefully
- Need fallback data sources

### 2. Incremental vs Full Fetch
- Currently fetches everything every time
- Should only get new data since last run
- Need to track "last_updated" timestamp

### 3. Alert System
- Generates signals but doesn't notify anyone
- Should send email/Discord/Slack when strong signals appear
- Priority levels for signals (urgent vs informational)

### 4. Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- Only does daily analysis
- Should combine daily/weekly/monthly signals for better accuracy

### 5. Position Awareness
- Doesn't know what you already own
- Should adjust signals based on current portfolio

### 6. Performance Metrics
- No tracking of how long operations take
- No success/failure metrics for monitoring

### 7. Dry-run Mode
- No way to test without writing to database
- Should have `--dry-run` flag for testing

## Files Created

### Python Sidecar (`quant/`)
- `quant/.gitignore` - Python-specific ignores
- `quant/.env.example` - Template for required environment variables
- `quant/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `quant/engine.py` - Main batch processing script
- `quant/data_sources/stock_fetcher.py` - Yahoo Finance data fetcher
- `quant/features/signal_generator.py` - RSI & SMA signal generation
- `quant/io/database.py` - Supabase database operations
- `quant/schema.sql` - Database tables for stock data and signals
- `quant/README.md` - Setup and usage instructions

### Frontend Components (`src/app/finance/`)
- `src/app/finance/page.tsx` - Finance page with data fetching
- `src/app/finance/StockDashboard.tsx` - Interactive dashboard UI
- Updated `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Added finance tab link

### CI/CD
- `.github/workflows/stock-data-update.yml` - Daily automated data updates

## M0 Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Setup Steps
1. ✅ **Supabase tables created**: Ran `quant/schema.sql` successfully
2. ✅ **Local environment configured**: 
   - Created `quant/.env` with Supabase credentials
   - Installed Python dependencies (resolved ta-lib and io module conflicts)
3. ✅ **Engine tested successfully**: 
   ```bash
   python engine.py
   # ✅ Fetched data for AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA
   # ✅ Saved 120 stock price records to Supabase
   # ✅ No signals generated (expected - needs more historical data)
   ```
4. ✅ **Frontend verified**: Finance tab displays real stock data from Supabase
5. ✅ **GitHub Action ready**: CI entry point configured for automation

### Technical Issues Resolved
- **Import conflict**: Renamed `io/` → `database/` to avoid Python built-in module conflict
- **Dependencies**: Removed unused `blog_assets` table and code for cleaner codebase
- **Environment variables**: Properly mapped Next.js env vars to Python format

### Next Steps for M1+
- Configure GitHub secrets for automated daily runs
- Accumulate more historical data for RSI signal generation
- Add notification system for trading alerts
- Implement retry logic and error handling
- Add position awareness and portfolio tracking
