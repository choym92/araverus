## Clean Slate - Project Reset

### What
- **Complete project cleanup**: User requested a fresh start from very basics
- **Removed quantitative trading system**: Deleted entire `quant/` directory 
- **Disabled automation**: Removed GitHub Actions workflow for stock data updates
- **Process documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md with enhanced development workflows

### Why
- User wanted to "start from very basics" after returning from previous work
- Previous quant system had become complex and potentially overwhelming
- Need for clean foundation before building new features

### How
1. **Cleanup Actions**
   - Cleared todo list completely
   - Deleted all files in `.claude/commands/` directory
   - Removed entire `quant/` directory and all contents
   - Deleted GitHub Actions workflow `stock-data-update.yml`

2. **CLAUDE.md Enhancements**
   - Added date stamp requirement for all .md files
   - Enhanced session file management rules
   - Added language rules (English only)
   - Imported structured development workflow (PRD → Tasks → Implementation)
   - Added team collaboration guidelines
   - Enhanced session start/end workflows
   - Expanded MCP usage guidelines for Serena and Context7

### Files Modified
- `CLAUDE.md` - Major enhancements with development process improvements
- `docs/cc/2025-09-03.md` - New daily log (this file)

### Files Deleted
- `.claude/commands/*.md` - All command files removed
- `quant/` - Entire directory and contents removed
- `.github/workflows/stock-data-update.yml` - Automated workflow removed

### Impact
- ✅ Clean slate ready for new project direction
- ✅ No automated processes running that could cause confusion
- ✅ Enhanced development workflow documentation
- ✅ Better session management and collaboration practices
- ✅ Clear MCP usage guidelines for future development

### Next Steps
- Ready to start fresh with whatever direction user chooses
- All automation cleared, no background processes
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md provides better development structure
- Clean repository state for new initiatives

### Notes
- User emphasized wanting to start from "very basics"
- Complete reset provides clean foundation
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md will improve future development practices
- Ready for whatever comes next!
