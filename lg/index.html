const segmentAnalysis = {
    purchaser: {
        summary: `The purchaser segment reveals a critical tension: your highest-value customers are fighting through significant friction to convert.

Cluster C9 ("Friction Fighters") shows 2.77 checkout regressions on average—meaning users are going back from checkout nearly 3 times before completing purchase. Despite this friction, they still convert at $1,307 AOV, suggesting these are motivated buyers who would convert faster (and possibly buy more) with a smoother checkout.

The ThinQ App ecosystem (C7) represents a strategic lock-in opportunity: 18.6% of all purchases come through app users, with 90% buying accessories. This isn't just a channel—it's a recurring revenue engine for consumables and add-ons.

Most concerning: 65-77% of top clusters are "promo hunting," indicating your base has been trained to expect discounts. This erodes margin and creates purchase timing dependency around promotional periods.`,

        summary: `$24.7M sits abandoned in carts—but not all abandonment is equal. The data reveals two distinct behavioral patterns requiring different interventions.

Pattern 1: "Quick Drop" (C7, C8) - Users add to cart then leave within seconds. C7 alone holds $5M in abandoned value. These aren't window shoppers—47% are returning visitors who added high-ticket items ($2,847 avg cart). Hypothesis: price shock at cart, or using cart as a "save for later" function.

Pattern 2: "Checkout Strugglers" (C5, C4) - These users WANT to buy but can't. C5 shows 2.91 checkout regressions with 72% experiencing payment flow issues. They've already committed mentally; technical friction is the only barrier.

The sleeper issue: 29% of C1 ("High-Value Checkout Starters") encountered out-of-stock after building $1,482 carts. They did everything right—your inventory visibility failed them.`,

        summary: `337K browser sessions represent your largest addressable conversion opportunity—but they're not a monolith. The segmentation reveals specific conversion blockers for each behavior type.

The "Research Obsessed" (C2) cluster is your highest-intent non-buyer: 99.6% engage with reviews, spending 8+ minutes per session. But 32% encounter out-of-stock items, killing their purchase journey. These aren't casual browsers—they're doing due diligence before a major purchase. Fix OOS visibility and this cluster converts.

"Promo Hunters" (C4) show 100% promo page engagement with 25% login rate—the highest of any browser cluster. They're not browsing; they're waiting for the right deal. The 25% login rate means you have their email. This is a retargeting goldmine if timed with promotions.

The concerning pattern: "Quick Scanners" (C8) represent 31% of browser traffic but leave in under 2.5 minutes with minimal engagement. 68% are new visitors arriving via Direct—likely brand-aware but finding nothing compelling. Landing page optimization could capture this traffic.`,

The red flag: C8 ("Repair Heavy") shows 69% repair intent with a 19% escalation rate. That means 1 in 5 users couldn't self-serve and needed human intervention. At scale, this is a significant support cost driver. The fix: better troubleshooting content, clearer repair booking flow, or proactive outreach for known issues.

The hidden opportunity: C6 ("Parts Shoppers") shows 33% parts purchase intent, but cart addition rates are near zero across all support clusters. Users are researching parts but not buying—likely due to part identification friction or lack of clear "add to cart" paths from support pages.

The loyalty signal: C1 ("Warranty Seekers") at 66% of traffic indicates a large base of warranty-active customers. These are your most engaged owners—ideal for extended warranty upsells, accessory recommendations, or loyalty program enrollment.`,
