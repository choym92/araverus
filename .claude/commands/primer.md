# Prime Context for Claude Code

IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the codebase. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.

Use the command `tree` to get an understanding of the project structure.
Read key files in the src/ or root directory

## Instructions
Initialize a new Claude Code session with comprehensive project context:

1. **Analyze Codebase Structure**
   - Run git ls-files to understand file organization and project layout
   - Execute directory tree commands (if available) for visual structure
   - Identify key directories and their purposes
   - Note the technology stack and frameworks in use
  

2. **Read Project Documentation**
   - Read README.md for project overview and setup instructions
   - Check for any additional documentation in docs/ or ai_docs/
   - Review any CONTRIBUTING.md or development guides
   - Look for architecture or design documents
   - Understand Project Context

3. **Identify the project's primary purpose and goals**
   - Note any special setup requirements or dependencies
   - Check for environment configuration needs
   - Review any CI/CD configuration files
   - Provide Concise Overview

4. **Summarize the project's purpose in 2-3 sentences**
   - List the main technologies and frameworks
   - Highlight any important setup steps
   - Note key areas of the codebase
   - This command helps establish context quickly when:

5. **Starting work on a new project**
   - Returning to a project after time away
   - Onboarding new team members
   - Preparing for deep technical work

he goal is to "prime" the AI assistant with essential project knowledge for more effective assistance.
